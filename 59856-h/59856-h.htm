<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>BREAD street ward, so called from
Bread street in Cheapside, which
was formerly a bread market, is encompassed
on the north and north west
by Faringdon ward; on the west by
Castle Baynard ward; on the south by
Queenhithe ward; and on the east by
Cordwainers ward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal streets in this ward are,
Watling street, Bread street, Friday
street, Distaff lane, Basing lane, with
the east side of the Old Change, from
the corner of St. Austin’s church to Old
Fish street, and the north side of Old
Fish street, and Trinity lane, with that
part of the south side of Cheapside, between
Friday street and Bow church.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most remarkable places are, the
parish churches of Allhallows Bread
street, and St. Mildred’s; with Cordwainers
hall.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>This ward is governed by an Alderman,
his Deputy, and twelve other
Common Council men, thirteen wardmote
inquest men, eight scavengers,
sixteen constables, and a beadle. The
jury returned by the inquest for the
ward, are to serve in the several courts
at Guildhall in the month of April.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Brentford</span>, a town in Middlesex, situated
ten miles from London, received
its name from a brook called Brent, which
runs through the west part of the town,
called Old Brentford, into the Thames.
As it is a great thoroughfare to the west,
it has a considerable trade, particularly
in corn, both by land and the Thames.
The church and market-house stand in
that part of the town called New Brentford.
It has also two charity schools; tho’
the church is only a chapel to Great Eling.</p>

<p class='c009'>That part of it called Old Brentford is
situated upon a fine rising bank close to
the Thames, and is naturally capable of
being made as beautiful a spot as any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>thing of the kind. The opposite side
of the river is Kew Green, which appears
from hence to advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Brentwood</span>, or <span class='sc'>Burntwood</span>, in Essex,

constantly passing through it to London,
with provisions, manufactures, and
droves of cattle; tho’ it is one of the four
hamlets belonging to the parish of Southwold
cum Brent.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Bride’s</span>, or rather St. Bridget’s church,
is obscurely situated behind the houses on
the south side of Fleet street. It has been
always dedicated to St. Bridget, but the
curious are unable to discover who this
saint was. The old church was destroyed
by the fire of London, and the present
edifice was erected within fourteen
years after. This church, which is superior
to most of our parish churches in
delicacy and true beauty, is 111 feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>long, 87 broad, and the steeple is 234
feet high. It has a plain and regular body,
the openings all answering one another;
the roof is raised on pillars, and the
altar piece, like the outside of the church,
is very magnificent. The circular pediment
over the lower part, is supported
by six Corinthian columns. The steeple
is a spire of extremely delicate workmanship,
raised upon a solid yet light tower,
and the several stages by which the spire
gradually decreases, are well designed,
and executed with all the advantage of
the orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>This church is a vicarage, the advowson
of which is in the Dean and Chapter
of Westminster. The living is worth
about 240<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the several monumental inscriptions
in this church, and the church
yard, is the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><span class='sc'>Bridewell</span>, so called from its being near a
spring called St. Bridget’s, or St. Bride’s
well, situated on the west side of Fleet
Ditch, near the Thames, was anciently a
royal palace, where several of our Kings
resided. And here Henry VIII. built a
magnificent house for the reception of the
Emperor Charles V. who before lodged
at Black Friars.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length at the solicitation of Bishop
Ridley, King Edward VI. gave the old
palace of Bridewell to the city, for the
lodging of poor wayfaring people, the
correction of vagabonds, strumpets, and
idle persons, and for finding them work;
and as the city had appointed the Grey
Friars, now called Christ’s Hospital, for
the education of poor children; St. Bartholomew’s
and also St. Thomas’s in
Southwark for the maimed and diseased,
his Majesty formed the Governors of
these charitable foundations into a corporation;
allowed them a proper authority
for the exercise of their offices, and
constituted himself the founder and patron.
For this purpose he gave to the
Lord Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens,
and their successors for ever, several
pieces of land to the yearly value of
450<i>l.</i> and at the same time suppressing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>hospital of the Savoy, gave for the above
charitable uses a great part of the revenue,
together with the bedding and
furniture.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the following reigns granaries and
storehouses for coals were erected at
the expence of the city within this hospital,
and the poor were employed in
grinding corn with hand-mills; which
were greatly improved in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, when a citizen invented
a mill, by which two men might grind
as much corn in a day as could be ground
by ten men with the other mills, and
being to be worked either by the hands
or feet, if the poor were lame in the
arms, they earned their living with their
feet, and if they were lame in their legs,
they earned their living with their arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the year 1666, this edifice was
entirely consumed by fire, and likewise
all the dwelling houses in the precinct of
Bridewell, from whence had arisen two
thirds of its revenue; the hospital however
was rebuilt in 1668, in the manner
in which it at present appears.</p>

<p class='c009'>It consists of two courts, in which the
buildings are convenient, and not very
irregular. The chapel has a square roof,
and galleries on the north and west side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>supported by columns of the Tuscan order,
and the floor is paved with black and
white marble. At the west end are
places for the hospital boys, and others
for the prisoners. The wainscoting and
finishing are very neat. The altar piece
is adorned with two pilasters, with their
entablature and a circular pediment of the
Corinthian order, between which the
commandments are done in gold upon a
black ground, and the Lord’s prayer and
the creed wrote on a blue ground; these
pieces are enriched with gilt cherubims,
leaves and fruit, and placed in gilt
frames. The court room is adorned with
columns of the Composite order, a gallery,
and the names of all the benefactors
to the hospital wrote in gold. There
is here a chair for the President, and convenient
seats for the Governors.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this hospital are generally about a
hundred youths, that are apprentices to
glovers, flaxdressers, weavers, &amp;c. who
reside there. These youths are under
particular regulations, and distinguish
themselves at all dangerous fires, by the
dexterity with which they work an excellent
fire engine belonging to the hospital,
and the expedition and regularity
with which they supply it with water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>They are cloathed in blue doublets
and white hats; and having faithfully
served their apprenticeship, are not only
free of the city, but have 10<i>l.</i> towards
enabling them to carry on their respective
trades.</p>

<p class='c009'>This hospital is likewise used as a
house of correction for all strumpets,
nightwalkers, pickpockets, vagrants, and
incorrigible and disobedient servants,
who are committed by the Lord Mayor,
and Aldermen; as are also apprentices
by the Chamberlain of the city, who
are obliged to beat hemp, and if the nature
of their offence requires it, to undergo
the correction of whipping.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the affairs of this hospital are managed
by the Governors, who are above
three hundred, besides the Lord Mayor
and court of Aldermen, all of whom
are likewise Governors of Bethlem
hospital; for these hospitals being one
corporation, they have the same President,
Governors, Clerk, Physician, Surgeon,
and Apothecary. This hospital
has however its own steward, a porter,
a matron, and four beadles, the youngest
of whom has the task of correcting
the criminals.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>There are several other places also
called by the name of Bridewell, as in
Clerkenwell, St. Margaret’s hill, and
Tothill fields; but as these are merely
houses of correction, they do not deserve
a particular description.</p>

itself, and is situated on a considerable
spot of ground on the south bank of the
Thames, near St. Olave’s church. It
had formerly several granaries, for the
service of the city in a time of scarcity;
and also ten ovens for baking bread, for
the relief of the poor citizens: but these
granaries are now applied to the use of
the cornfactors, who here lay in considerable
quantities of corn. The Bridge
house is under the management of the
Bridge-master, whose office is to look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>after the reparation of the bridge, and is
allowed a considerable salary.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>British Museum.</span> Sir Hans Sloane,
Bart. (who died 11th Jan. 1753) may
not improperly be accounted the founder
of the British Museum: for its being
established by Parliament was only in
consequence of his leaving by will his
noble collection of natural history, his
large library, and his numerous curiosities,
which cost him 50000<i>l.</i> to the use
of the Public, on condition that the Parliament
would pay 20000<i>l.</i> to his Executors.
And indeed this disposition of
Sir Hans was extremely well calculated
to answer his generous design; for had
he given the whole to the Public, without
any payment at all, it could have
been of little use, without the assistance
of Parliament, to settle a fund for the
support of officers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Hans appointed a number of Trustees,
on whose application to Parliament
an act was passed for the raising 300000<i>l.</i>
by way of lottery; 200000<i>l.</i> thereof
to be divided amongst the adventurers,
20000<i>l.</i> to be paid to Sir Hans Sloane’s
executors, 10000<i>l.</i> to purchase Lord
Oxford’s manuscripts, 30000<i>l.</i> to be
vested in the funds for supplying salaries
for officers, and other necessary expences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and the residue for providing a general
repository, &amp;c. In this act it is also ordered,
that Sir Hans Sloane’s collection,
the Cottonian library, the Harleian manuscripts,
and a collection of books
given by the late Major Edwards, should
be placed together in the general repository,
which was to be called the British
Museum: 7000<i>l.</i> left by the said Major
Edwards, after the decease of Elizabeth
Mills, are also given to the British
Museum, for the purchasing of manuscripts,
books, medals, and other curiosities.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened very fortunately soon after,
whilst the Trustees were at a loss
where to purchase or build a proper repository,
an offer was made them of
Montague House in Great Russel street,
Bloomsbury, a large and magnificent
building, finely ornamented with paintings,
situated in the most convenient part
of the whole town, and having an extensive
garden of near eight acres. This
they purchased for the sum of 10000<i>l.</i>
Repairs, alterations, book-cases, cabinets,
and all other conveniences for
placing the whole collection properly,
and the making apartments for the officers,
have cost 15000<i>l.</i> more. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>every part is now so excellently contrived
for holding this noble collection, and the
disposition of it in the several rooms is
so orderly and well designed, that the
British Museum may justly be esteemed
an honour and ornament to this nation.
His Majesty, in consideration of its great
usefulness, has also been graciously pleased
to add thereto the royal libraries of
books and manuscripts collected by the
several Kings of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>As this noble collection of curiosities,
and these excellent libraries are now
chiefly designed for the use of learned
and studious men, both natives and foreigners,
in their researches into the several
parts of knowledge, the Trustees
have thought fit to ordain the following
statutes, with respect to the use of the
Museum.</p>

<p class='c009'>I. That the Museum be kept open
every day in the week except Saturday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and Sunday in each week; and likewise
except Christmas day and one week
after; one week after Easter day and
Whitsunday respectively, Good Friday,
and all days which shall hereafter be appointed
for Thanksgivings and Fasts by
publick Authority.</p>

<p class='c009'>II. That at all other times the Museum
be set open in the manner following:
that is, from nine o’clock in the
morning till three in the afternoon, from
Monday to Friday, between the months
of September and April inclusive; and
also at the same hours on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday, in May, June,
July, and August; but on Monday and
Friday, only from four o’clock to eight
in the afternoon, during those four
months.</p>

<p class='c009'>III. That such studious and curious
persons, who are desirous to see the Museum,
be admitted by printed tickets, to
be delivered by the porter upon their
application in writing; which writing
shall contain their names, condition, and
places of abode; as also the day and
hour at which they desire to be admitted:
and that the said names be inserted
in the tickets, and, together with their
respective additions, entered in a register
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>to be kept by the porter. And the porter
is to lay such register every night before
the principal Librarian; or, in his
absence, before the under Librarian,
who shall officiate as Secretary for the
time being; or, in his absence, before
one of the under Librarians; to the end
that the principal or under Librarian
may be informed, whether the persons
so applying be proper to be admitted according
to the regulations made, or to
be made, by the Trustees for that purpose.
And if he shall judge them proper,
he shall direct the porter to deliver
tickets to them, according to their request,
on their applying a second time
for the said tickets.</p>

<p class='c009'>IV. That no more than ten tickets
be delivered out for each hour of admittance,
which tickets, when brought by
the respective persons therein named,
are to be shewn to the porter; who is
thereupon to direct them to a proper
room appointed for their reception, till
their hour of seeing the Museum be
come, at which time they are to deliver
their tickets to the proper officer of the
first department: and that five of the
persons producing such tickets be attended
by the under Librarian, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>other five by the assistant in each department.</p>

<p class='c009'>V. That the said number of tickets
be delivered for the admission of company
at the hours of nine, ten, eleven,
and twelve respectively in the morning;
and for the hours of four and five in the
afternoon of those days in which the
Museum is to be open at that time: and
that if application be made for a greater

leave is not to be granted for a longer
term than half a year, without a fresh

<p class='c009'>III. That a particular room be allotted
for the persons so admitted, in
which they may sit, and read or write,
without interruption, during the time
the Museum is kept open: that a proper
officer do constantly attend in the
said room, so long as any such person or
persons shall be there: and for the greater
ease and convenience of the said persons,
as well as security of the collection, it is
expected, that notice be given in writing
the day before, by each person, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the said officer, what book or manuscript
he will be desirous of perusing the following
day; which book or manuscript on
such request, will be lodged in some convenient
place in the said room, and will
from thence be delivered to him by the
officer of the said room: excepting however
some books or manuscripts of great
value, or very liable to be damaged, and
on that account judged by the Trustees
not fit to be removed out of the library
to which they belong; without particular

a work of learning, have occasion to
make a drawing of any thing contained
in the department of natural and artificial
productions, or to examine it more
carefully than can be done in the common
way of viewing the Museum; he
is to apply to the Trustees in a general
meeting, or the standing Committee,
for particular leave for that purpose: it
not being thought proper, unless in particular
cases, to have them removed
from their places, and out of the sight
of the officer who has the care of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>IX. That whensoever, and as often
as any person shall have occasion to consult
or inspect any book, charter, deed,
or other manuscript for evidence or information,
other than for studying, which
is herein before provided for; he is to
apply for leave so to do, to the Trustees
in a general meeting, or the standing
Committee. But if the case should require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>such dispatch as that time cannot
be allowed for making such application,
the person is to apply for such leave to
the principal Librarian; or, in case of
his death or absence, such of the under
Librarians as shall officiate as Secretary
for the time being: which leave the principal
Librarian, or the under Librarian
officiating as Secretary for the time being,
as aforesaid, is hereby impowered to
grant. Provided always, that no such
person shall be permitted to consult
or inspect any such book, charter,
deed, or other manuscript, except in the

one the principal officers of that department
to which such book, deed, charter,
or other manuscript shall belong.</p>

<p class='c009'>X. That no part of the collection or
collections belonging to this Museum,
be at any time carried out of the general
repository; except such books,
charters, deeds, or other manuscripts
as may be wanted to be made use of
in evidence. And that when any such
book, charter, deed, or other manuscript
shall be wanted to be made use of
in evidence, application shall be made
in writing for that purpose, to the Trustees
in a general meeting, or the standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Committee: and if the case should
require such dispatch, as not to admit of
an application to the Trustees in a general
meeting, or the standing Committee,
then to the principal Librarian; or
in case of his death or absence, then to
such of the under Librarians as shall officiate
as Secretary for the time being:
and thereupon by their or his direction,
the same shall and may be carried out
of the general repository, to be made use
of as evidence as aforesaid, by the under
Librarian or assistant of the department to
which such book, charter, deed, or other
manuscript shall belong. And in case the
said under Librarian, or assistant of the
said department be disabled, or cannot
attend; then by such other of the under
Librarians, or assistants, as shall be appointed
by the Trustees, in a general meeting,
or the standing Committee, or by the
chief Librarian, or by such of the under
Librarians as shall officiate as Secretary
for the time being aforesaid. And the
person who shall be appointed to carry
out the same, shall attend the whole
time, and bring it back with him again;
for which extraordinary trouble and attendance
it is expected that a proper satisfaction
be made to him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Altho’ it may be presumed, that persons
who shall be admitted to see the
Museum, will in general conform themselves
to the rules and orders above mentioned;
yet as it may happen, that
these rules may not always be duly observed:
the Trustees think it necessary,
for the safety and preservation of the
Museum, and do hereby order, That in
case any persons shall behave in any improper
manner, and contrary to the said
rules, and shall continue such misbehaviour
after having been admonished
by one of the officers; such persons
shall be obliged forthwith to withdraw
from the Museum; and their names shall
be entered in a book to be kept by the
porter: who is hereby ordered not to
deliver tickets to them for their admission
for the future; without a special
direction from the Trustees in a general
meeting.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Buckingham House</span>, is finely situated
at the west end of the Park. In the
front, which is towards the Mall and
the grand canal, it has a court inclosed
with iron rails. At the entrance of the
edifice, which is built with brick and
stone, is a very broad flight of steps,
upon which are four tall Corinthian pilasters,
that are fluted and reach to the
top of the second story, and at each
corner is a plain pilaster of the same order.
Within this compass are two series
of very large and lofty windows, over
which is the entablature, and in the
middle this inscription in large gold characters:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>SIC SITI LÆTANTUR LARES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Thus situated may the houshold Gods rejoice.</i></p>
<p class='c018'>Over this is an Attic story with square
windows and Tuscan pilasters, over which
was an <i>Acroteria</i> of figures representing
Mercury, Secrecy, Equity, Liberty &amp;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>but these figures were taken away soon
after the death of the late Duke of Buckingham.
On each side of the building
are bending colonades with columns of
the Ionic order, crowned with a balustrade
and vases. These colonades join
the offices at the extremity of the wings
to the main building, and each of these
offices is crowned with a turret, supporting
a dome, from which rises a
weathercock.</p>
<p class='c009'>Behind the house is a garden and
terrace, from whence there is a fine
prospect of the adjacent country, which
gave occasion to the following inscription
on that side of the house,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div>RUS IN URBE:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Intimating that it has the advantage of
both city and country; above which
were figures representing the four Seasons.</p>
<p class='c009'>The hall is paved with marble and
adorned with pilasters, and during the
life of the late Duchess, with a great variety
of good paintings, and on a pedestal
at the foot of the grand stair-case there
was a marble figure of Cain killing his
brother Abel.</p>

<p class='c009'>To this account of Buckingham
House we shall add the following letter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>written by the Duke of Buckingham
himself to the D—— of Sh—— containing
a farther description of it, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c019'>“You accuse me of singularity in resigning
the Privy Seal with a good
pension added to it, and yet afterwards
staying in town at a season
when every body else leaves it, which
you say is despising at once both Court
and Country. You desire me therefore
to defend myself, if I can, by describing
very particularly in what
manner I spend so many hours, that
appear long to you who know nothing
of the matter, and yet, methinks,
are but too short for me.</p>

<p class='c020'>“No part of this talk which you impose
is uneasy; except the necessity
of using the singular number so often.
That one letter (I) is a most dangerous
monosyllable, and gives an air
of vanity to the modestest discourse
whatsoever. But you will remember
I write this only by way of apology;
and that, under accusation, it is allowable
to plead any thing for defence,
though a little tending to our own
commendation.</p>

<p class='c020'>“To begin then without more preamble:
I rise, now in summer, about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>seven a clock, from a very large bedchamber
(entirely quiet, high, and
free from the early sun) to walk in
the garden; or, if rainy, in a saloon
filled with pictures, some good, but
none disagreeable: there also, in a
row above them, I have so many portraits
of famous persons in several
kinds, as are enough to excite ambition
in any man less lazy, or less at
ease, than myself.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Instead of a little closet (according
to the unwholesome custom of most
people) I chuse this spacious room for
all my small affairs, reading books or
writing letters; where I am never in
the least tired, by the help of stretching
my legs sometimes in so large a
room, and of looking into the pleasantest
park in the world just underneath
it.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Visits, after a certain hour, are not
to be avoided; some of which I own
to be a little fatiguing (tho’ thanks to
the town’s laziness, they come pretty
late) if the garden was not so near, as
to give a seasonable refreshment between
those ceremonious interruptions.
And I am more sorry than
my coachman himself, if I am forced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to go abroad any part of the morning.
For though my garden is such,
as by not pretending to rarities or curiosities,
has nothing in it to inveagle
ones thoughts; yet by the advantage of
situation and prospect, it is able to
suggest the noblest that can be; in
presenting at once to view a vast town,
a palace, and a magnificent cathedral.
I confess the last, with all its splendor,
has less share in exciting my devotion,
than the most common shrub in my
garden; for though I am apt to be
sincerely devout in any sort of religious
assemblies, from the very best (that
of our own church) even to those of
Jews, Turks, and Indians: yet the
works of nature appear to me the better
sort of sermons; and every flower
contains in it the most edifying rhetorick,
to fill us with admiration of its
omnipotent Creator. After I have dined
(either agreeably with friends, or at
worst with better company than your
country neighbours) I drive away to a
place of air and exercise; which some
constitutions are in absolute need of: agitation
of the body and diversion of the
mind, being a composition of health
above all the skill of Hippocrates.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“The small distance of this place
from London, is just enough for recovering
my weariness, and recruiting
my spirits so as to make me better
than before I set out, for either business
or pleasure. At the mentioning
the last of these, methinks I see you
smile; but I confess myself so changed
(which you maliciously, I know, will
call decayed) as to my former enchanting
delights, that the company
I commonly find at home is agreeable
enough to make me conclude the evening
on a delightful terrace, or in
a place free from late visits except of
familiar acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c020'>“By this account you will see that
most of my time is conjugally spent
at home; and consequently you will
blame my laziness more than ever, for
not employing it in a way which your
partiality is wont to think me capable
of: therefore I am obliged to go on
with this trifling description, as some
excuse for my idleness. But how such
a description itself is excusable, is
what I should be very much in pain
about, if I thought any body could see
it besides yourself, who are too good a
judge in all things to mistake a friend’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>compliance in a private letter, for the
least touch of vanity.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The avenues to this house are along
St. James’s Park, through rows of
goodly elms on one hand, and gay
flourishing limes on the other; that
for coaches, this for walking; with
the Mall lying betwixt them. This
reaches to my iron pallisade that encompasses
a square court, which has in
the midst a great basin with statues and
water-works; and from its entrance
rises all the way imperceptibly, till we
mount to a terrace in the front of a
large hall, paved with square white
stones mixed with a dark-colour’d
marble; the walls of it covered with
a set of pictures done in the school of
Raphael. Out of this on the right
hand we go into a parlour thirty-three
feet by thirty-nine, with a niche fifteen
feet broad for a beausette, paved
with white marble, and placed within
an arch with pilasters of divers colours,
the upper part of which as high as the
ceiling is painted by Ricci.</p>

<p class='c020'>“From hence we pass through a suite
of large rooms, into a bedchamber of
thirty-four feet by twenty-seven; within
it a large closet, that opens into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a green-house. On the left hand of
the hall are three stone arches supported
by three Corinthian pillars,
under one of which we go up eight
and forty steps, ten feet broad, each
step of one entire Portland stone.
These stairs by the help of two resting
places, are so very easy, there is no
need of leaning on the iron baluster.
The walls are painted with the story
of Dido; whom though the poet
was obliged to dispatch away mournfully
in order to make room for Lavinia,
the better natur’d painter has
brought no farther than to that fatal
cave, where the lovers appear just entering,
and languishing with desire.
The roof of this stair-case, which is
fifty-five feet from the ground, is
forty feet by thirty-six, filled with
the figures of Gods and Goddesses.
In the midst is Juno, condescending
to bed assistance from Venus, to bring
about a marriage which the Fates intended
should be the ruin of her
own darling queen and people. By
which that sublime poet intimates,
that we should never be over eager for
any thing, either in our pursuits, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>our prayers; lest what we endeavour
or ask too violently for our interest,
should be granted us by Providence
only in order to our ruin.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The bas reliefs and all the little
squares above are all episodical paintings
of the same story: and the largeness
of the whole had admitted of a
sure remedy against any decay of the
colours from salt petre in the wall, by
making another of oak laths four
inches within it, and so primed over
like a picture.</p>

<p class='c020'>“From a wide landing place on the
stairs head, a great double door opens
into an apartment of the same dimensions
with that below, only three feet
higher; notwithstanding which it
would appear too low, if the higher
saloon had not been divided from it.
The first room of this floor has within
it a closet of original pictures,
which yet are not so entertaining as
the delightful prospect from the windows.
Out of the second room a
pair of great doors give entrance into
the saloon, which is thirty-five feet
high, thirty-six broad, and forty-five
long. In the midst of its roof a round
picture of Gentileschi, eighteen feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in diameter, represents the Muses
playing in concert to Apollo lying
along on a cloud to hear them. The
rest of the room is adorned with
paintings relating to arts and sciences;
and underneath divers original
pictures hang all in good lights, by
the help of an upper row of windows
which drown the glaring.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Much of this seems appertaining to
parade, and therefore I am glad to leave
it to describe the rest, which is all for
conveniency. As first, a covered passage
from the kitchen without doors;
and another down to the cellars and
all the offices within. Near this, a
large and lightsome back stairs leads
up to such an entry above, as secures
our private bedchambers both from
noise and cold. Here we have necessary
dressing rooms, servants rooms,
and closets, from which are the pleasantest
views of all the house, with a
little door for communication betwixt
this private apartment and the great
one.</p>

<p class='c020'>“These stairs, and those of the same
kind at the other end of the house,
carry us up to the highest story, fitted
for the women and children, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the floors so contrived as to prevent
all noise over my wife’s head, during
the mysteries of Lucina.</p>

<p class='c020'>“In mentioning the court at first, I
forgot the two wings in it, built on
stone arches which join the house by
corridores supported by Ionic pillars.
In one of these wings is a large kitchen
thirty feet high, with an open
cupulo on the top; near it a larder,
brew-house, and laundry, with rooms
over them for servants; the upper sort
of servants are lodged in the other
wing, which has also two wardrobes
and a store-room for fruit. On the
top of all a leaden cistern holding fifty
tuns of water, driven up by an engine
from the Thames, supplies all the
water-works<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c021'><sup>[1]</sup></a> in the courts and gardens,
which lie quite round the house;
through one of which a grass walk
conducts to the stables, built round a
court, with six coach houses and forty
stalls. I will add but one thing before
I carry you into the garden, and that
is about walking too, but ’tis on the
top of all the house; which being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>covered with smooth milled lead, and
defended by a parapet of balusters
from all apprehension as well as danger,
entertains the eye with a far distant
prospect of hills and dales, and a
near one of parks and gardens. To
these gardens we go down from
the house by seven steps, into a gravel
walk that reaches cross the garden,
with a covered arbour at each end of
it. Another of thirty feet broad leads
from the front of the house, and lies
between two groves of tall lime trees,
planted in several equal ranks upon a
carpet of grass: the outsides of these
groves are bordered with tubs of bays
and orange trees. At the end of this
broad walk, you go up to a terrace
four hundred paces long, with a large
semicircle in the middle, from whence
is beheld the Queen’s two parks, and
a great part of Surry; then going
down a few steps, you walk on the
bank of a canal six hundred yards
long, and seventeen broad, with two
rows of limes on each side of it.</p>

<p class='c020'>“On one side of this terrace, a wall
covered with roses and jessamines is
made low, to admit the view of a
meadow full of cattle just under it, (no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>disagreeable object in the midst of a
great city) and at each end a descent
into parterres, with fountains and water-works.
From the biggest of these
parterres we pass into a little square
garden, that has a fountain in the
middle, and two green-houses on the
sides, with a convenient bathing
apartment in one of them; and near
another part of it lies a flower garden.
Below all this a kitchen garden, full
of the best sorts of fruits, has several
walks in it fit for the coldest weather.</p>

<p class='c020'>“Thus I have done with a tedious
description; only one thing I forgot,
though of more satisfaction to me than
all the rest, which I fancy you guess
already; and ’tis a little closet of books
at the end of that green-house which
joins the best apartment, which besides
their being so very near, are
ranked in such a method, that by its
mark a very Irish footman may fetch
any book I want. Under the windows
of this closet and green-house,
is a little wilderness full of blackbirds
and nightingales. The trees,
tho’ planted by myself, require lopping
already, to prevent their hindring
the view of that fine canal in the Park.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“After all this, to a friend I’ll expose
my weakness, as an instance of the
mind’s unquietness under the most
pleasing enjoyments. I am oftener
missing a pretty gallery in the old
house I pulled down, than pleased
with a saloon which I built in its
stead, though a thousand times better
after in all manner of respects.</p>

<p class='c020'>“And now (<i>pour fair bonne bouche</i>,
with a grave reflection) it were well
for us, if this incapacity of being entirely
contented was as sure a proof
of our being reserved for happiness
in another world, as it is of our frailty
and imperfection in this. I confess
the divines tell us so, but tho’ I believe
a future state more firmly than a great
many of them appear to do, by their
inordinate desires of the good things in
this; yet I own my faith is founded,
not on those fallacious arguments of
preachers, but on that adorable conjunction
of unbounded power and
goodness, which certainly must some
way recompense hereafter so many
thousand of innocent wretches created
to be so miserable here.”</p>

interment of such corps as could not
have room in their parochial burial

of the Doric order which joins the

Hertfordshire, adjoining to which is a
spacious common, called <i>Bushy Heath</i>,
extending towards Stanmore, in the
county of Middlesex. This heath rises
to a considerable height, and from its
top affords a most delightful prospect.
On the one hand we have a view of St.
Alban’s, and of all the space between,
which appears like a garden: the inclosed
corn fields seem like one grand parterre:
the thick planted hedges resemble
a wilderness or labyrinth: the villages
interspersed thro’ the landscape, appear
at a distance like a multitude of gentlemen’s
seats. To the south east is seen
Westminster Abbey, more to the south
appears Hampton Court, and on the
south west Windsor Castle, with the
Thames winding between both, through
the most beautiful parts of Middlesex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and Surry, its banks adorned with towns,
and a multitude of magnificent seats of
the nobility.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Butcherhall</span> <i>lane</i>, Newgate street. Formerly
a market being kept in Newgate

lane: but the market being removed
after the fire, and this lane rebuilt, here
the company of butchers had their hall,
whence it took its name.</p>

by Henry II. in the year 1180, as an

the King’s licence; though they were
not incorporated till the year 1605. This
company consists of a Master, five Wardens,
twenty-one Assistants, and two
hundred and fourteen Liverymen, who
pay a fine of 2<i>l.</i> each upon their admission
into the livery. They have a neat
and convenient hall in Pudding lane, in
which are three handsome rooms neatly
wainscoted and adorned with fretwork.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Castle Street School</span>, was founded
by Dr. Tennison, at the same time with
the library. In 1697, that gentleman
gave 1000<i>l.</i> towards a fund for the
maintenance of his foundation, and some
time after, by the consent of Dr. Patrick,
Bishop of Ely, another sum of 500<i>l.</i>
which had been left them jointly in trust,
to dispose of in charitable uses, as they
thought proper: which two sums, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>with two leasehold messuages for
the term of forty years, he vested in
trustees, for the support of his school and
library; out of the profits of which the
librarian has the allowance mentioned above;
the schoolmaster, besides a commodious
dwelling house, has a salary of 30<i>l.</i>
<i>per annum</i>; and the usher the same salary
without any apartment; for which they
teach thirty boys, the sons of the inhabitants
of St. Martin’s in the fields.

of Creechurch lane in Leadenhall
street. The addition of the word <i>Cree</i>, arose
from the English spelling of the word
Christ as pronounced by the French;
for this church being placed on the
ground of a dissolved priory, which with
its church was called our Saviour
Christ’s church, tho’ it was dedicated to
the virgin martyr St. Catharine, the original
name of that priory became added
to its denomination. The present edifice
was erected in the year 1630, and is a very
singular structure, built with stone, and of
a mixed Gothic style. It has rounded battlements
on the top, and a square tower
that has the same kind of battlements:
this tower is crowned with a square turret,
over which is a dome, and from its
summit rises the weather cock.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a curacy, and the parishioners
have the privilege of choosing their
own minister, who must be licensed by
the Bishop of London. The Curate receives
70<i>l.</i> a year, exclusive of other
advantages. <i>Maitland.</i></p>
<p class='c010'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Catharine Coleman</span>, on the south
side of Fenchurch street, is thus denominated
from its been dedicated to the same
saint as the two former churches, and the
epithet of Coleman is added from there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>being formerly near it a large haw, yard,
or garden, called Coleman-haw.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old church escaped the flames
at the fire of London; but becoming
very ruinous, was rebuilt by the parish
in the year 1734. The body is lofty,
and enlightened with two series of windows;
and the steeple, a plain tower
crowned with battlements.</p>

<p class='c009'>This church is a rectory, in the gift
of the Bishop of London. The living
is worth about 100<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Catharine’s</span> <i>Church</i>, on the east side
of St. Catharine’s court, near the Tower,
originally belonged to an hospital founded
by Matilda, consort to King Stephen,
and was farther endowed by Queen Eleanor,
the relict of Henry III. Queen Eleanor
consort to Edward I. and King Henry
VI. who not only confirmed all the former
grants, and added several additional ones,
but gave an ample charter to this hospital.
It was exempt from the jurisdiction
of the Bishop of London, till its suppression
by Henry VIII. soon after which
King Edward VI. annexed it to the diocese
of London. The church, which
is a very antique building, is at present
collegiate, and has a master and three
brethren, who have 40<i>l.</i> each; three
sisters who have 20<i>l.</i> and ten beadswomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>who have 8<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i> each: but
the other profits arising from their
estates, being only known to the master
and brethren, are divided amongst them.

a spacious area which contains between

both the rails and wall being much decayed,
now make but an indifferent appearance.
The square is, however, encompassed
by noble buildings: the Lord
Harcourt has a fine house on the east
side; on the west is a noble edifice belonging
to Mr. Lane, formerly the Lord
Bingley’s; and in the center of the north
side is a space left for a house intended
to be erected by the late Duke of Chandos,
the wings only being built; however,
there is a handsome wall and
gates before this space, which serve
to preserve the uniformity of the square.
Adjoining to this square, Lord Foley
has just built a very grand house, with
offices, and a court before it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lord</i> <span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span>, a great officer of
the King’s houshold, who has the oversight
of all the officers above stairs, except
the precinct of the King’s bedchamber,
which is under the government of
the Groom of the stole. He has the
oversight of the King’s Chaplains, notwithstanding
his being a layman; also
of the officers of the wardrobe, beds,
tents, revels, music, comedians, hunting,
and of all the physicians, apothecaries,
surgeons, barbers, messengers, trumpets,
drummers, tradesmen and artisans
retained in his Majesty’s service. His salary
is 100<i>l.</i> a year, and 1100<i>l.</i> a year board
wages. His office is in Cleveland row.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span> <i>of London</i>, an officer of
great trust, annually chosen on Midsummer
day, tho’ he enjoys his place for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>life, if he is not found guilty of some
great crime. He receives and pays all
the city cash, and with him are deposited
all public securities, for which he
annually accounts to the proper auditors.
As he is therefore entrusted with very
considerable sums, he is obliged to give
security for his fidelity, at his entrance
into his office.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chamberlain’s</span> <i>Office</i>, is kept in Guildhall,
in a room on the right hand side
of the passage leading into the court of
King’s bench, where this officer attends
every morning, to decide the differences
that arise between masters and apprentices,
to enrol and turn over the latter, and to admit
all who are duly qualified, to the freedom
of the city; of whom there are annually
admitted about fifteen hundred.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Lord High</i> <span class='sc'>Chancellor</span>, the supreme and
sole judge in the court of Chancery,
where he is to judge according to equity
and conscience, and to moderate the exact
rigour and letter of the common law,
to which all other judges are strictly tied;
but his decrees may be reversed by the
house of Lords. This great officer, who is
assisted by the masters in Chancery, takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>precedency after the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and next to the King, and
Princes of the blood, is the highest person
in the kingdom in civil affairs. The Lord
High Chancellor is generally Keeper of
the great seal, and is thence stiled Lord
Keeper. See the article <i>Lord</i> <span class='sc'>Keeper</span>.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span> <i>of the Exchequer</i>. See the
article <span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chancellor</span> <i>of St. Paul’s</i>, an officer anciently
called <i>Magister Scholarum</i>, from his
having the literature of the city committed
to his care, by which he was impowered
to license all the schoolmasters in
London, except those of St. Martin’s le
Grand, and Mary le Bow; but at present
he is only Secretary to the Chapter,
and has the third stall on the north side
of the choir.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>Court of</i> <span class='sc'>Chancery</span>. In the opinion of
several learned men this court took its
name from the cross bars of iron or wood,
called by the Romans <i>cancelli</i>, with
which it was formerly inclosed, to prevent
the officers being incommoded by
the crowding of the people. The Chancery
consists of two courts, in one of
which the Lord Chancellor proceeds according
to the laws and statutes of the
kingdom, and in the second, according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>equity, judging rather by the spirit than
the letter of the laws. In case of absence,
his place upon the bench is supplied by
the Master of the rolls, who also determines
causes in the same equitable manner.
See the article <i>Lord</i> <span class='sc'>Chancellor</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the peculiar business of this court
to rescue people out of the hands of
their oppressors, and to afford relief in
case of fraud, accidents, and breach of
trust. Besides, out of this court are issued
writs for parliaments, charters,
patents for sheriffs, writs of <i>certiorari</i>
to remove records and false judgments
in inferior courts, writs of <i>moderata misericordia</i>,
when a person has been
amerced too high, and for a reasonable
part of goods for widows and orphans.
Here also are sealed and enrolled, treaties
with foreign Princes, letters patent,
commissions of appeal, oyer and terminer,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>The manner of proceeding here is
much like that in the courts of the civil
law; for the actions are by bill or
plaint; the witnesses are privately examined;
there is no jury, but all the sentences
are given by the judge of the
court. However as it proceeds not according
to law, it is no court of record,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and therefore binds only the person, his
lands and goods.</p>

<p class='c009'>To this court belong twelve masters
in chancery; an accountant general; six
head clerks; sixty-two sworn clerks, who
purchase their places, and twelve waiting
clerks, whose places are given by the six
clerks; two chief examiners, with their
respective clerks; a chief and four inferior
registers; the clerk of the crown;
a prothonotary; clerks of the petty bag,
subpæna, patent, affidavit, cursitors, and
alienation office.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Masters in</i> <span class='sc'>Chancery</span>, are the twelve assistants
of the Chancellor or Lord Keeper,
the first of whom is Master of the
rolls, which is a place of great dignity,
and is in the gift of the King. These gentlemen
sit at Westminster hall, with the
Lord Chancellor, three at a time while
the term lasts, and two at a time when
the Lord Chancellor sits to hear causes
in his own house, and to them he often
refers the farther hearing of causes; he
also refers to them matters of account,
and other things of small moment; but
never the merits of the cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>The salary of the Masters in chancery
is 100<i>l.</i> to each of them paid quarterly
out of the Exchequer, besides robe money.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chapel Royal</span>, a chapel in each of the
King’s palaces, neatly ornamented on the
inside. They are under the government
of a Dean, who acknowledges no superior
but his Majesty; for the Chapel
Royal, or King’s Chapel, is not within
the jurisdiction of any Bishop, but is a
regal peculiar under the immediate government
of the King. By the Dean
are chosen the Sub-dean and all the
other officers.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are the King’s Clerk of the
closet, a Divine whose office is to attend
at his Majesty’s right hand during divine
service, to wait on his Majesty in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>private oratory; and to resolve all his
doubts relating to religious subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty-eight Chaplains in Ordinary,
who are generally Doctors of Divinity
distinguished for their learning and other
accomplishments. Four of whom wait
at court every month, to preach in the
chapel on Sundays, and other Holidays
before the King, and early in the morning
on Sundays before the houshold; to
read divine service to his Majesty every
morning and evening during the rest of
the week in his private oratory, and to
say grace at the table in the absence of
the Clerk of the closet.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other officers are, a Confessor of
the King’s houshold, whose office is to
read prayers every morning to the family,
to visit the sick, to examine and prepare
communicants; and to inform such as
desire advice in any case of conscience or
point of religion. Ten Priests in Ordinary,
sixteen gentlemen of the Chapel
Royal, who with the Priests perform
in the chapel the office of divine service,
in praying, singing, &amp;c. a master
of the singing boys, of whom there are
ten for the service of the chapel; a composer,
two organists, a lutenist, a violist,

<i>Stow.</i> However, after the restoration
an equestrian statue of King

this cross stood, which is still, tho’ very
improperly, called Charing Cross. This
statue has the advantage of being well
placed; the pedestal is finely elevated,
and the horse full of fire and spirit; but
the man is not perhaps equally well
executed: so that upon the whole it can
neither be generally condemned, nor

Spring Garden, Charing Cross. This
Society was incorporated by Queen Anne
in the year 1708, for the relief of the
industrious poor, by assisting them with
small sums, lent upon pledges at legal
interest. For this purpose the corporation
were impowered to raise a fund not
less than 20, nor more than 30,000<i>l.</i> but
this sum being afterwards increased by
additional grants to 600,000<i>l.</i> was, instead
of being employed to the mutual
advantage of the poor, and of the proprietors,
villainously embezzled by the
company’s cashier, warehouse keeper,
and others, the two former of whom
fled to France to shelter themselves from
justice. Upon this the proprietors applied
to parliament, and had a lottery
granted for their relief; while those
who had fled were invited to return
and produce the books and effects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of the corporation; and on their not
complying were declared felons.</p>

<p class='c009'>This corporation were by their charter
enjoined not to interfere with the Bank
of England by discounting of bills; nor
to trade in any other business but that
of lending money upon pledges, which
they were to advance upon legal interest,
and a reasonable allowance for charges.
Their affairs were under the direction of
a committee of seven of the proprietors,
three or more of whom constituted a
court, impowered to make by-laws for
the better government of the company,
and to appoint their cashier, warehouse
keepers, accomptant, clerks, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the prosperity of this corporation
they had two offices, one in Spring
Garden, and the other on Laurence Poulteney’s

that in the city to be laid aside.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charlton</span>, a pleasant well-built village
in Kent, on the edge of Blackheath;
famous for a very disorderly fair held in
its neighbourhood, on St. Luke’s day,
when the mob who wear horns on their
heads, take all kinds of liberties, and the
lewd and vulgar among the women
give a loose to all manner of indecency.
This is called Horn Fair, and there are
sold at it, Rams horns, horn toys and
wares of all sorts. Of this fair a vulgar
tradition gives the following origin: King
John having a palace at Eltham, in this
neighbourhood, and being hunting near
Charlton, then a mean hamlet, was separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>from his attendants, when entering
a cottage he admired the beauty
of the mistress, whom he found alone,
and debauched her; her husband, however,
suddenly returning, caught them
in the fact, and threatening to kill them
both, the King was forced to discover
himself, and to purchase his safety with
gold, besides which he gave him all the
land, from thence as far as the place
now called Cuckold’s Point, and also
bestowing on him the whole hamlet,
established a fair, as a condition of his
holding his new demesne, in which
horns were both to be sold and worn.
A sermon is preached on the fair day in
the church, which is one of the handsomest
in the county, and was repaired
by Sir Edward Newton, Bart. to whom
King James I. granted this manor. This
gentleman built his house at the entrance
of the village: it is a long Gothic structure,
with four turrets on the top; it
has a spacious court yard in the front,
with two large Gothic piers to the gates,
and on the outside of the wall is a long
row of some of the oldest cypress trees in
England. Behind the house are large
gardens, and beyond these a small park
which joins to Woolwich common. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>house now belongs to the Earl of Egmont.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the edge of the hill, and at a small
distance from the church, are two fine
houses, one of which was in the possession
of the late Governor Hunter, and the
other was erected by the late Lord Romney.
The gardens being on the side of
the hill, slope down towards the river,
and render the prospect very delightful
in summer, from the extensive view
they afford of the country, and of the
great number of ships that are generally
sailing by every tide: but being fully
exposed to the north wind, the fruit trees
are generally blighted; and in winter time
the air is said to be made unwholesome
by the water which frequently overflows
the neighbouring plains.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Charterhouse.</span> This edifice was originally
a religious foundation. In the
year 1349 a terrible pestilence swept
off more than half the inhabitants of
London; and the church yards being
unable to contain the dead, Sir Walter
Manny, Bart. a foreign gentleman, who
had been honoured with the order of the
Garter by King Edward III. for his bravery
in the field, purchased for a burial
ground a spot of thirteen acres, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the Charterhouse now stands, and 50,000
persons are said to have been buried there
in the space of that year.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following year that public benefactor
built a chapel upon the spot, according
to the religion of those times,
for prayers to be said for the souls of all
who had been interred there, and afterwards
founded a monastery of the Carthusians
in the same place. This monastery,
by the corruption of the word
<i>Cartreux</i>, by which the French mean a
Carthusian house, obtained the name of
Charterhouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>This monastery being dissolved at the
reformation, at length fell to the Earl
of Suffolk, who disposed of it to Thomas
Sutton, Esq; a citizen of London, for
13,000<i>l.</i> The latter then applied to
King James I. for a patent for his intended
charitable foundation, which was
readily granted in the year 1611, and
confirmed by parliament in 1628. The
expence of fitting up the house for the
reception of his pensioners and scholars
amounted to 7000<i>l.</i> which added to
the purchase money, made 20,000<i>l.</i> But
this was not all, he endowed his hospital
and school with fifteen manors, and
other lands, to the value of above 4490<i>l.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><i>per annum</i>. And the estate is at present
improved to above 6000<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this house are maintained eighty
pensioners, who, according to the institution
are gentlemen, merchants, or
soldiers, who are fallen into misfortunes.
These are provided with handsome apartments,
and all the necessaries of life,
except cloaths, instead of which each of
them is allowed a gown, and 7<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are also forty-four boys supported
in the house, where they have
handsome lodgings, and are instructed in
classical learning, &amp;c. Besides these,
there are twenty-nine students at the
universities, who have each an allowance
of 20<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i> for the term
of eight years. Others who are judged
more fit for trades, are put out apprentices,
and the sum of 40<i>l.</i> is given with
each of them. As a farther encouragement
to the scholars brought up on this
foundation, there are nine ecclesiastical
preferments in the patronage of the
Governors, who, according to the constitution
of the hospital, are to confer
them upon those who were educated
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pensioners and youths are taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in at the recommendation of the Governors,
who appoint in rotation. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The buildings, which are extremely
rude and irregular, have nothing but
their convenience and situation to recommend
them. The rooms are well
disposed, and the square in the front
is very neat, and kept in as good order
as most in town. This square and the
large gardens behind, give a free air, and
at one and the same time contribute both
to health and pleasure.</p>

name from the Saxon word <i>Chepe</i>, a market,
there being one kept in this division

known by the name of West Cheap,
to distinguish it from the market, between
Candlewick street, and Tower street,
called East Cheap.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal streets in this ward are,
Bucklersbury, the north side of Pancras

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chelsea</span>, a very large and populous village,
two miles from London, pleasantly
situated on the banks of the Thames
almost opposite to Battersea. Here is the
physic garden belonging to the company
of Apothecaries of London, a particular
account of which the reader may find in
the article relating to that company. Sir
Robert Walpole, the late Earl of Orford,
had here for some time a house adorned
with a noble collection of pictures, which
was afterwards removed to Houghton-hall
in Norfolk, and is now thought
the finest collection in England<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c021'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. There
are several other private buildings worthy

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chelsea</span> <i>Hospital</i>, a noble edifice erected
for the invalids in the land servive. The
original building on this spot was a college
founded by Dr. Sutkliff, Dean of
Exeter, in the reign of King James I. for
the study of Polemic divinity, and was
endowed in order to support a Provost
and Fellows, for the instruction of youth
in that branch of learning. The King,
who laid the first stone, gave many of the
materials, and promoted the work by a
large sum of money, and the clergy were
very liberal upon the same occasion; but the
sum settled upon the foundation by Dr.
Sutkliff being far unequal to the end proposed,
the rest was left to private contributions;
and these coming in slowly, the
work was stopped before it was finished,
and therefore soon fell to ruin. At
length the ground on which the old college
was erected, becoming escheated to
the crown, Charles II. began to erect the
present hospital, which was carried on
by James II. and completed by William
and Mary.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole edifice, which was built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>by the great Sir Christopher Wren, consists
of a vast range of buildings. The front
toward the north opens into a piece of
ground laid out in walks for the pensioners;
and that facing the south, into a
garden which extends to the Thames,
and is kept in good order. This side affords
not only a view of that fine river,
but of the county of Surry beyond it.
In the center of this edifice is a pediment
supported by four columns, over which
is a handsome turret, and through this
part is an opening which leads through
the building. On one side of this entrance
is the chapel, the furniture and
plate of which was given by K. James I.
and on the other side is the hall, where
all the pensioners dine in common, the
officers by themselves. In this hall is
the picture of King Charles II. on horseback,
with several other pieces as big
as the life, designed by Signior Vario,
and finished by Mr. Cook. These were
presented by the Earl of Ranelagh. The
pavement of both the chapel and hall
are black and white marble. The altar
piece in the chapel is the resurrection,
painted by Sebastian Ricci.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wings, which extend east and
west, join the chapel and hall to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>north, and are open towards the Thames,
on the south; these are near 360 feet
in length, and about 80 in breadth, they
are three stories high, and the rooms are
so well disposed, and the air so happily
thrown in by means of the open spaces,
that nothing can be more pleasant. On
the front of this square is a colonade extending
along the side of the hall and
chapel, over which upon the cornice is
the following inscription in capitals.</p>

<p class='c024'><i>In subsidium et levamen emeritorum senio,
belloque fractorum, condidit</i> <span class='sc'>Carolus

<p class='c009'>And in the midst of the quadrangle is the
statue of King Charles II. in the ancient
Roman dress, somewhat bigger than the
life, standing upon a marble pedestal.
This was given by Mr. Tobias Rustat,
and is said to have cost 500<i>l</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are several other buildings adjoining,
that form two other large
squares, and consist of apartments for the
officers and servants of the house; for
old maimed officers of horse and foot,
and the infirmary for the sick. None of
these are shewn in the two views we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>have given, which only represent the two
principal fronts of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c009'>An air of neatness and elegance is observable
in all these buildings. They
are composed of brick and stone, and
which way soever they are viewed, there
appears such a disposition of the parts as is
best suited to the purposes of the charity,
the reception of a great number, and the
providing them with every thing that
can contribute to the convenience and
pleasure of the pensioners.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chelsea Hospital is more particularly
remarkable for its great regularity and
proper subordination of parts, which is
very apparent in the north front. The
middle is very principal, and the transition
from thence to the extremities, is
very easy and delightful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The expence of erecting these buildings
is computed to amount to 150,000<i>l.</i>
and the extent of the ground is above
forty acres.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the wings are sixteen wards,
in which are accommodations for above
400 men, and there are besides in the
other buildings, a considerable number
of apartments for officers and servants.</p>

<p class='c009'>These pensioners consist of superannuated
veterans, who have been at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>twenty years in the army; or those soldiers
who are disabled in the service of
the crown. They wear red coats lined
with blue, and are provided with all other
cloaths, diet, washing, and lodging.
The Governor has 500<i>l.</i> a year; the
Lieutenant Governor 250<i>l.</i> and the Major
150<i>l.</i> Thirty-six officers are allowed 6<i>d</i>.
a day; thirty-four light horsemen, and
thirty serjeants, have 2<i>s.</i> a week each;
forty-eight corporals and drums have
10<i>d</i>. per week; and three hundred and
thirty-six private men, are each allowed
8<i>d</i>. a week. As the house is called a garrison,
all the members are obliged to do
duty in their respective turns; and they
have prayers twice a day in the chapel,
performed by two chaplains, who have
each a salary of 100<i>l.</i> a year. The physician,
secretary, comptroller, deputy
treasurer, steward, and surgeon, have also
each 100<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and many other
officers have considerable salaries. As to
the out-pensioners, who amount to between
eight and nine thousand, they have
each 7<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>. a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>These great expences are supported by
a poundage deduced out of the pay of
the army, with one day’s pay once a year
from each officer and common soldier;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and when there is any deficiency, it is
supplied by a sum raised by parliament.
This hospital is governed by the following
commissioners; the President of the
council, the first Commissioner of the
treasury, the Principal Secretary of state,
the Pay master general of the forces, the
Secretary at war, the Comptrollers of
the army, and by the Governor and
Lieutenant Governor of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chertsey</span>, a town in Surry, nineteen miles
from London, carries on a considerable
trade in malt, which is sent in barges to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>London.  Here was once an abbey,
in which was deposited the corpse of
Henry VI. who was stabbed in the
Tower, but his body was afterwards removed
by Henry VII. to Windsor. Out
of the ruins of this abbey Sir Henry
Carew, master of the buckhounds to
King Charles II. built a very fine house.
To this village Cowley, the Poet, retired
after being weary of attending on
the court, and there ended his days.

very elegant structure, built by the Nobleman
from whom it derives its name.
The stone colonades leading from the
house to the wings on each side are very
beautiful. The print exhibits the body
of the house with part of the colonade,

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chingford</span>, a village in Essex, near Woodford,
and not far from Epping Forest,
so agreeably situated for privacy and
retirement, that the remotest distance
from the metropolis can hardly exceed
it. The church, which was erected in
the reign of King Richard II. is a neat
little building dedicated to St. Peter and
Paul.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chipping Ongar</span>, a town in Essex, twenty
miles from London, was formerly the
manor of Richard Lacy, who being Protector
of England, while Henry II. was
absent in Normandy, he built a church
and a castle here with other fortifications,
the remains of which are still to
be seen.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chislehurst</span>, a town near Bromley, in
Kent, where the family of the Walsinghams
resided for several generations;
and are interred in the church. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Mr. Camden composed the principal part
of his annals of Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Chiswick</span>, in Middlesex, situated on the
Thames on the south-west side of Hammersmith.
Here are two manors, one
belonging to the Prebendary of Cheswick
in St. Paul’s cathedral, and the
other call’d the Dean’s manor, from its
belonging to the Dean and Chapter of
St. Paul’s. In this village there is a charity
school, and it is adorned with several
elegant seats, as the Earl of Shrewsbury’s,
the Earl of Grantham’s now Col.
Elliot’s, the late Lord Wilmington’s,
&amp;c. But the most remarkable of the
kind is the late Earl of Burlington’s,
which was a plain, commodious building,
with good offices about it; but a
part of the old edifice being some years
ago destroyed by fire, his Lordship erected
near it a beautiful villa, which, for
elegance of taste, surpasses every thing
of its kind in England. The court in the
front, which is of a proportionable size
with the building, is gravelled and constantly
kept very neat. On each side
are yew hedges in panels, with <i>Termini</i>
placed at a proper distance; and in the
front of these hedges, are two rows of
Cedars of Libanus, which, at a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>distance have a fine effect, the dark shade
of these solemn ever-greens affording a
pleasing contrast to the whiteness of the
elegant building that appears between
them, the view of which from the road
surprizes you in a most agreeable manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ascent to the house is by a noble
flight of steps, on one side of which is
the statue of Palladio, and on the other
that of Inigo Jones. The portico is
supported by six fine fluted columns of
the Corinthian order, with a pediment
very elegant, and the cornice, frize and
architrave, as rich as possible. This
magnificent front strikes all who behold
it with an uncommon pleasure
and surprize.</p>

<p class='c009'>The octagonal saloon finishing at top
in a dome, through which it is enlightened,
is also very elegant. The other
rooms are extremely beautiful, and are
finely furnished with pictures of the great
masters; an account of which is here
annexed. It were to be wished this
house had been built to a larger scale,
that the grandeur might have equalled
the elegance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though the other front towards the
garden is plainer, yet it is in a very bold,
noble and masterly stile, and has at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>same time a pleasing simplicity, as hath
also the side front towards the serpentine
river, which is different from the
two others. In making the drawing
of this house, it was viewed by the
angle, by which means the print here
given of it, shews it more perfectly than
if only the principal front had been
given. The inside of this structure is
finished with the utmost elegance; the
ceilings are richly gilt and painted, and
the rooms adorned with some of the best
pictures in Europe. In the gardens,
which are very beautiful, the vistos are
terminated by a temple, obelisk, or
some such ornament, which produce a
most agreeable effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardens are laid out in the finest
taste: on descending from the back part
of the house you enter a verdant lawn
planted with clumps of ever-greens, between
which are two rows of large
stone vases. At the ends next the house
are two wolves in stone, done by the
celebrated Scheemaker, the statuary; at
the farther end are two large lions, and
the view is terminated by three fine antique
statues, dug up in Adrian’s garden
at Rome, with stone seats between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>them, and behind a close plantation of
ever-greens.</p>

<p class='c009'>On turning to the house on the right
hand, an open grove of forest trees affords
a view of the orangery, which is seen as
perfectly as if the trees were planted on
the lawn; and when the orange trees are
in flower, their fragrance is diffused over
the whole lawn to the house. These
are separated from the lawn by a fossee,
to secure them from being injured by
the persons admitted to walk in the
garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>On leaving the house to the left, an easy
slope covered with short grass leads down
to the serpentine river, on the side whereof
are clumps of ever-greens, with
agreeable breaks, between which the
water is seen; and at the farther end is
an opening into an inclosure, where are
a Roman temple, and an obelisk, with
grass slopes, and in the middle a circular
piece of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>From hence you are led to the
wilderness, through which are three
strait avenues terminated by three different
edifices; and within the quarters
are serpentine walks, through which you
may ramble near a mile in the shade.
On each side the serpentine river, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>verdant walks, which accompany the
river in all its turnings. On the right
hand of this river is a building that is
the exact model of the portico of the
church of Covent garden, on the left is
a wilderness laid out in regular walks,
and in the middle is a Palladian wooden
bridge over the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the earth dug from the bed of
this river, his Lordship has raised a terrace,
that affords a prospect of the adjacent
country; which, when the tide is
up, is greatly enlivened by the view of the
boats and barges passing along the river
Thames.</p>

dedicated to a Jewish convert and martyr,
named before his conversion Reprobus,
but having, it is pretended, carried
our Saviour over a river, was thence
named Christopher. Mention is made
of a church in this place so early as the
year 1368. The present edifice suffered
greatly by the fire of London; but not
so much as to occasion its being rebuilt,
and therefore being thoroughly repaired,
it continues on the ancient foot. The
body is well enlightened, and the tower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>is crowned with four handsome pinacles.
It is a very plain edifice, and indeed had
it been ever so well ornamented, it could
not, in its present situation, have been
seen to advantage.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church is a rectory, the patronage
of which has been for above three
hundred years in the Bishop of London.
The Rector, besides other considerable
advantages, receives 120<i>l.</i> a year in lieu

The district in which this edifice
stands was till lately considered as a hamlet
in the parish of Stepney: but the
kind reception given to the persecuted
French protestants, greatly increased the
number of the inhabitants of this spot,
and these refugees bringing the silk manufacture
along with them, soon brought
affluence to the place, and with it a
multitude of new inhabitants. Hence
this was constituted a distinct parish
from Stepney in the year 1728, and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of the fifty new churches was ordered to
be built here. The foundation was laid
in 1723, and it was finished in four
years.</p>

<p class='c030'>The body of this church is solid and
well proportioned; it is ornamented
with a Doric portico, to which there is
a handsome ascent by a flight of steps;
and upon these the Doric order arises
supported on pedestals. The tower over
these rises with arched windows and
niches, and on its diminishing for the
steeple, is supported by the heads of the
under corners, which form a kind of
buttresses: from this part rises the base
of the spire, with an arcade; its corners
are in the same manner supported with a
kind of pyramidal buttresses ending in a
point, and the spire is terminated by a
vase and fane. This is the character
given of this edifice in the <i>English Architect</i>:
who asserts that solidity without
weight is its character, and that though
this structure is not without faults, yet it
is worthy of great praise; it being singular,
and built for ages. It has however
been severely censured by the author
of <i>The Critical Review of Buildings</i>,
who says that it is one of the most
absurd piles in Europe.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>This church is made a rectory, but is
not to be held in commendam. For the
maintenance of the Rector and his successors
the Parliament granted the sum
of 3000<i>l.</i> to be laid out in the purchase
of lands and tenements in fee simple:
besides which provision the Churchwardens
are by that act appointed to pay
him annually the sum of 125<i>l.</i> to be
raised by burial fees. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Christ’s Church</span>, in Bennet street, Southwark,
is a regular and well-constructed
building, erected with little expence,
since the year 1737, when the foundation
of the old church gave way. It
consists of a plain body enlightened by
two ranges of windows, and a square
tower with a turret.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church is a rectory, the patronage
is in the heirs and assigns of John
Marshal of the Borough of Southwark,
Gent. who caused the old church to be
built, by leaving, in the year 1627, the
sum of 700<i>l.</i> for that purpose, with an
estate of 60<i>l.</i> a year towards the maintenance
of a Minister, and the inhabitants
applying to parliament in 1670, it
was made a distinct parish independent
of that of St. Saviour’s.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Christ’s Church</span>, behind the northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>row of houses in Newgate street. This
is a vicarage, or impropriation, and the
right of advowson is in the Governors of
St. Bartholomew’s hospital. The old
spacious church being consumed by the
fire of London, this edifice was erected
in its room, and by an act of parliament
constituted the place of public worship,
both for this parish and that of St. Leonard’s
Foster lane.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church is a plain edifice, neatly
ornamented on the inside; it has a square
tower of a considerable height, crowned
with a light and handsome turret, which
is so concealed by the houses, that it
can scarce any where be seen to advantage.
The Incumbent receives 200<i>l.</i> per
annum in lieu of tithes.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Christ’s Hospital</span>, for the education
and support of the fatherless children of
freemen, is an establishment of considerable
antiquity; for Henry VIII. in the
last year of his reign gave the city both
the priory of St. Bartholomew’s, and the
convent of Gray Friars, which anciently
belonged to that priory, for the relief
of the poor. He also in the same year
founded two churches out of these religious
houses, the one to be called Christ
Church, out of the Gray Friars, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>other Little St. Bartholomew’s, out of
the hospital of that name. By the above
grant the city was obliged to establish
here a settled and regular provision for
the poor, which was not done till some
years after, when King Edward VI. being
extremely moved at a sermon preached
by Bishop Ridley, wherein that good
Prelate expatiated on the obligations of
the rich to assist the poor and miserable,
his Majesty expressed his hearty desire to
concur in promoting so laudable a work,
and by the Bishop’s advice, immediately
caused a letter to be wrote to the Lord
Mayor, to obtain his assistance; and this
letter his Majesty signed with his own
hand, and sealed with his signet. The
good Bishop, who, by the young King’s
desire, stayed till the letter was finished,
was the messenger dispatched on this important
business. The chief Magistrate
was pleased with the honour done the
city, and after several consultations with
the Aldermen and Common Council, several
charitable plans were formed for
the carrying on of this and other charities;
and while the diseased were provided
for at St. Thomas’s, and the idle at
Bridewell, it was resolved that the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and helpless should be educated at Christ
Church.</p>

<p class='c030'>This being reported to the King, his
Majesty voluntarily incorporated the Governors
of these houses by the title of
<i>The Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of the
City of London, Governors of the possessions,
revenues and goods of the hospitals of
Edward VI., King of England</i>, &amp;c. as
his Majesty desired to be esteemed their
chief founder and patron. To promote
and continue this work, he granted the
city certain lands that had been given to
the house of the Savoy, founded by King
Henry VII. for the lodging of pilgrims
and strangers, but which was now only
used by vagabonds and strumpets. These
lands amount to the yearly value of
600<i>l.</i> He also commanded, that after
reserving a sufficient quantity of the linen,
which had been used in the times of popish
superstition, to each church within
the city and suburbs of London, the remaining
superfluous great quantities
should be delivered to the Governors of
this hospital, for the use of the poor children
under their care. And one of the
last actions of that good Prince’s life,
was signing a licence for this corporation
to purchase lands in mortmain.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>In 1552 the house of the Gray Friars
was prepared for the poor fatherless children,
and the same year 340 were admitted.
Soon after, several considerable
private benefactions were left to this hospital,
and at length Charles II. by a well
judged liberality, founded and endowed
a mathematical school for the instruction
of forty boys in that study, in order to fit
them for the sea, and for this purpose he
ordered 1000<i>l.</i> a year to be paid out of
the Exchequer for seven years. This
institution is executed in a manner suitable
to the intention of the founder.
Every year ten of these boys are put out
apprentices to masters of ships, and ten
more are received in their room. The
master is not only expected to be a good
mathematician, but to understand the
learned languages. Afterwards the Governors
appointed forty other boys to be
taught mathematics in the same manner.
The other schools are a grammar school,
a writing school, and a school for the
girls who learn reading and needle work,
and there have been lately added a master
to teach the boys drawing, an art of the
greatest use in many mechanical arts.</p>

<p class='c030'>This charity is so very extensive, that
there are sometimes above a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>children supported here at a time. The
youngest, for whom there is not room in
the house, and who are not of an age to
understand the lessons taught there, are,
at the expence of the charity, sent to
Hertford and Ware, where there are
schools erected and masters employed at
handsome salaries for that purpose. As
the eldest are put out apprentices, and
these grow more fit for the place, they
are brought in.</p>

<p class='c030'>The boys are cloathed in blue coats,
with petticoats of the same colour, yellow
stockings, and bonnets instead of
hats. And on their being put out apprentice,
they have 10<i>l.</i> given with each.</p>

<p class='c030'>The edifice is concealed by the contiguous
houses, and cannot be seen
entire. It is spacious, and though built
in the old manner, is not ill contrived.
The principal buildings form the four
sides of a large area, which have porticoes
continued round them. These have
Gothic arches, and the walls are supported
by abutments. The front of the
building is, however, more modern
than the rest, and has Doric pilasters
supported on pedestals.</p>

<p class='c030'>Among the ancient buildings that still
remain, is an old cloister, which was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>part of the priory. This was repaired
by the direction of Sir Christopher Wren,
and serves both for a thoroughfare, and
place of recreation for the boys, especially
in rainy weather.</p>

<p class='c030'>The writing school is, however, a neat
modern edifice, built with brick and
stone in the year 1694, at the end of the
great hall. It was founded by Sir John
Moore, one of the Aldermen of the city,
and President of the house, whom it is
said to have cost 5000<i>l.</i> It contains long
writing boards sufficient for 300 boys to
sit and write upon, and at the upper end of
the room is Sir John’s statue in white marble.</p>

<p class='c030'>The inner distribution of the rooms
and wards is very good. There is a spacious
hall built at the expence of Sir John
Fenwick after the fire of London, in
which the boys dine and sup. At the
upper end of this room is a large picture
representing King James II. sitting with
his Nobles, the Governors, &amp;c. with the
half figures of King Edward VI. and
Charles II. hanging as pictures in the
same piece. There is also a piece representing
the mathematical school done
by Vario, and reckoned worth 1000<i>l.</i>
At the other end is a large piece representing
King Edward VI. delivering the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>charter to the Lord Mayor, who kneels,
with the Aldermen behind him; the
young King is accompanied by Bishop
Ridley and several others, who stand
about him. Here also is a fine piece
of the pool of Bethesda, which is very
large, and painted in a masterly stile by
Mr. Hogarth. In this hall there is likewise
a good organ, which plays on Sundays,
when the boys sing psalms and
anthems.</p>

<p class='c030'>A great room where the Governors
meet, is also adorned with the pictures of
the royal founder, and of all the chief
benefactors.</p>

<p><i>Christ’s-Church Hospital.</i><br /><i>S. Wale delin.</i>      <i>J. Taylor sc.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>There are eight wards for the children’s
beds; that of the girls is separated
from the rest; and there is also a ward
for the sick. Each of the masters have
100<i>l.</i> a year, and the grammar master
an additional salary of 20<i>l.</i> for catechising
the boys, and his usher has 50<i>l.</i> a
year; in short, 12 or 1300<i>l.</i> a year is
expended in salaries to the officers,
clerks, and servants; and the sum expended
for the support of the hospital,
amounts to between 11 and 12,000<i>l.</i> a
year.  To defray this expence, the
hospital has a great annual revenue in
houses and lands; the benefit of licensing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and looking after the 420 carts allowed
in the city, each of which pays a certain
sum for sealing. The hospital has likewise
a duty of about three farthings upon
every piece of cloth brought to Blackwell
hall, where clerks are kept to receive it.
The Governors, amount to about three
hundred, and these chuse their officers
and servants, both men and women,
and also the President and Treasurer.</p>

<p class='c030'>The building of this hospital is partly
Gothic and partly modern, being built at
various times, and has very little regularity.
That part represented in the print
belongs to the mathematical school, and
is in Gray Friars. The niche contains
a statue of Charles II. in the royal robes,
which, considering the difficulty the
statuary had to encounter, is a very good
one. At a distance is the steeple and
part of the front of the church,
which was rebuilt, after being burnt
down by the fire of London, by Sir
Christopher Wren.</p>

and distinguished by their situation with
respect to each other. West Clandon
is twenty-six miles from London, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the manor of the Lord Onslow, whose
title is Lord of Onslow and Clandon,
and whose seat is near the church. It is
a noble edifice, erected after an Italian
model. The gardens are beautiful, and
laid out in the modern taste. It has
plenty of good water, and commands a
delightful and extensive prospect as far
as Windsor. The house is seen from
the road up a grand avenue, and appears
to be, what it really is, one of the finest
seats in that part of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c030'>East Clandon lies about two miles
to the east of the last mentioned village,

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Claremont</span>, is the seat of his Grace the
Duke of Newcastle at Esher. The house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>was designed and built by the late Sir
John Vanbrugh, in a whimsical style of
architecture, which is better shewn in
the print than described. It was afterwards
purchased of Sir John by his Grace,
who has been at great expence in improving
the place. The structure, though
singular, does not appear to be irregular.
It is built of brick with a good deal of
variety in it, and of considerable extent,
but not much elevated. The Duke has
since built a grand room for the reception
of company when numerous, which makes
the ends of the house not appear similar.
The house has a lawn in the front
shaded on each side with trees, and the
ground behind it rising gradually shews
the trees there also, so that the house
appears to be embowered by them except
just in the front; and the white
summer house with four little pinacles,
one at each corner, built on the mount
which gives name to the place, when
viewed from before the front of the
house, rises up finely from behind the
trees, and all together forms a very pleasing
appearance. The park in which it
is situated is distinguished by its noble
woods, lawns, walks, mounts, prospects,
&amp;c. The summer house call’d the Belvedere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>at about a mile distance from the
house, on that side of the park next
Esher, affords a very beautiful and
extensive view of the country quite
round; yet that from the summer house
at Esher place, which is just by, is
perhaps no way inferior to it.</p>

A church has been situated in the same
place at least ever since the year 700;
but the present edifice began to be erected
in 1680, and was compleated in two
years, but the steeple was not added till
several years after.</p>

<p class='c030'>The body of the church, which is of
stone, has two series of windows, the
lower plain and the upper well ornamented,
and the termination is by an
attic, whose pilasters are crowned with
vases. On the south side it is entered by
a portico to which there is an ascent of a
few steps, this portico is covered with a
dome supported by Ionic columns. Opposite
to this there is another, and on
each side the base of the steeple in the
west front is a small square tower with
its dome. The steeple is carried to a
great height in several stages: where it
begins to diminish the Ionic order takes
place, and upon its entablature supports
vases. The next stage is Corinthian, and
above that stands the Composite supporting
a dome which is crowned with a
smaller one, from whence rises the ball
and its fane.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The author of the <i>New Critical Review
of the publick Buildings</i> justly censures
the situation of this church in the
midst of the street, and their having
“in compliance with the superstitious
custom of placing it in a due east and
west situation, crowded the backside of
the church into the face of the people,
though they had room enough to build
it otherwise, and prevent so capital a
nuisance.” This church is a rectory,
in the patronage of the Earl of Exeter.</p>

The old church was destroyed by the

its ruin the present edifice arose. It
is a very plain neat structure, with a
tower crowned only by a battlement.</p>

by the name of <i>The fraternity of St.
Nicholas</i>, by which they were known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>till they were incorporated by charter in
1611. By a decree of the court of Star
chamber, they obtained the privilege of
keeping a printing press in their hall, for
printing the bill of mortality, they being
strictly enjoined by their charter to make
a report of all the christenings and burials
in their respective parishes by six
o’clock, on Thursday in the afternoon;
but this is by a by-law changed to two
o’clock on the same day, that the King
and the Lord Mayor may have the account
the day before its publication.
This list is however extremely defective;
for as there are above an hundred meeting
houses in the bills of mortality, the
members of which never have their
children christened in the parish churches,
though the far greater number of their
dead are interred in the parochial burying
grounds, the burials in these lists are
made greatly to exceed the christenings;
and hence very grave remarks have been
made on the unhealthfulness of the city,
and the vices of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c030'>This company consists of a Master,
two Wardens, seventeen Assistants, and

dramatic representations of certain
parts of scripture; for which they
were so famous, that not only the Lord
Mayor and citizens, but even the nobility
were their spectators. From this well
a neighbouring priory with the church

Ligonier, and another, the seat of Mr.

villa. The principal rooms are richly
ornamented; the ceilings are gilt; and
the offices below are not only convenient,
but contrived with great judgment, so as
to answer the purposes for which they
were designed. As the house is situated
on an eminence, it commands the prospect
of the adjacent fields, which are
kept in great order. The river Mole
passes along by the side of the gardens,
and being made here four or five times,
broader than it was naturally, it has a
happy effect, especially as the banks are
disposed into a slope, with a broad grass

very elegant room, which is a delightful
retreat in hot weather, it being shaded
with large elms on the south side, and
having the water on the north and east
sides, is extremely cool and pleasant. The
house is situated about half a mile from

much hid by the trees near it, as not to
be seen till you rise on the heath beyond

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Common Council.</span> These are the representatives
of the commons, and compose
one of the parts of the city legislature,
which nearly resembles that of the kingdom;
for as the latter consists of the
King, Lords, and Commons, so this is
composed of the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen
and Common Council; the principal
difference is, that the three estates
of the kingdom enjoy separately the
right of a negative, while in the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>this right is confined to the Aldermen
and Common Council.</p>

<p class='c030'>Before the year 1347, there were only
two Common Council men returned
for each ward, which being thought inefficient
to represent the numerous body
of the commons, it was at that time
agreed, that each of the city wards
should chuse a number of Common
Council men according to its dimensions;
but none to exceed twelve, nor
any to have less than six; which has
been since increased to the present
number.</p>

<p class='c030'>The city is now divided into twenty-five
wards, and they into 236 precincts,
each of which lends a representative,
who is elected in the same manner as
an Alderman; with this only difference,
that as the Lord Mayor presides in the
wardmote, and is judge of the poll at
the election of an Alderman, the case
is the same with the respect to the Aldermen
in their several wards, at the choice
of Common Council men. <i>Maitland.</i></p>
<p class='c025'><i>The Court of</i> <span class='sc'>Common Council</span>, consists
of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
representatives of the several wards,
who assemble in Guildhall, as often as
the Lord Mayor, by his summons, thinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>proper to convene them, in order to
make by-laws for the government of
the city. They annually select six Aldermen
and twelve Commoners for letting
the city lands, and this committee
generally meet at Guildhall on Wednesdays.
They also appoint another committee
of four Aldermen and eight Commoners
for transacting the affairs belonging
to Gresham College, who generally
meet at Mercers hall, according
to the appointment of the Lord Mayor,
who is always one of the number. Besides
the appointing of these, and several
other committees, they by virtue of
a royal grant, annually chuse a Governor,
Deputy, and Assistants, for the
management of the city lands in Ireland.
They have likewise a right to dispose of
the offices of town clerk, common
serjeant, judges of the Sheriffs court,
common crier, coroner, bailiff of the
borough of Southwark, and city garbler.

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Common Crier</span>, an office of the city,

summon all executors and administrators
of freemen to appear, and bring
inventories of their personal estates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>within two months after their decease.
He is also obliged to attend the Lord

by his place an Esquire.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Common Hunt</span>, the chief huntsman of
the city, whose principal business is to
take care of the city hounds, and to

has a house allowed him in Finsbury
Fields, where the hounds are kept, and
for their support he has a considerable
annual allowance, besides his perquisites.
He is also to attend the Lord Mayor
on set days, and is by his place an
Esquire.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Common</span> <i>lane</i>, in Thames street.</p>
<p class='c025'><i>Court of</i> <span class='sc'>Common Pleas</span>. This is one
of the four great courts of the kingdom,
and is so called because in that court are
debated the usual or common pleas between
subject and subject, and all civil
causes whatsoever. It was anciently
ambulatory, and followed the King
wheresoever he went; but at the confirmation
of <i>Magna Charta</i>, by King
John, in 1215, it was fixed at Westminster,
where it still continues.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Soon after the fixing of this court at
Westminster, such a multitude of causes
were brought before it, that the King
for the greater dispatch of business, found
it necessary instead of three, to constitute
six Judges, whom he appointed to sit in
two places: but at present the number
being only four, they sit together in
Westminster hall to hear and decide
causes; but no Counsellor can plead before
them under the degree of a Serjeant.</p>

<p class='c030'>The chief Judge in this court is the
Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,
who has a salary of 2500<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.
with his robes and two tons of wine;
the other, who are called the three
puisne Judges of this court, and also four
Serjeants, are each allowed fees, reward
and robes, the puisne Judges having
2000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i> each.</p>

<p class='c030'>The other officers of this court are,
the Custos Brevium; three Prothonotaries
and their Secondaries; several clerks,
who have their several counties allotted
them, and are to engross the fines levied
on lands in their respective divisions; the
Chirographer; the Register of the fines,
and a Clerk of the proclamations. The
Prothonotaries and Chirographer sit in
the court covered with black round caps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>which was the fashion before the invention
of hats and wigs. These are all
sworn and have their offices for life. See

<p class='c030'>In this court there are three officers
unsworn, viz. a clerk of the treasury, a
clerk of the enrollments of fines and recoveries,
and a clerk of the outlawries:
there are besides a clerk of the King’s
silver; a clerk of the warrants; a clerk
of the juries; a clerk of the essoins; a
clerk of the supersedeas; filazers for the
several counties of England; an exigenter;
four criers and a porter.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Common Serjeant</span>, an officer of the
city, who is obliged to attend the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen on court
days, and to be in council with them on
all occasions, both within and without
the precincts or liberties of the city; and
formerly he was to take care of the estates
of the city orphans.</p>
<p class='c025'><i>House of</i> <span class='sc'>Commons</span>, also called <i>St. Stephen’s
Chapel</i>, joins to the south east angle of
Westminster hall. The print represents
a view as seen from the Cotton Garden.
King Stephen first founded a chapel here,
and dedicated it to St. Stephen the Protomartyr:
but Edward III. rebuilding
it in the year 1347, in a very magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>manner, converted it into a collegiate
church, the revenues of which at
its suppression amounted to 1085<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
and 5<i>d</i>. <i>per annum</i>: but being surrendered
to Edward VI. it was appropriated
for the reception of the representatives
of the Commons of England, who have
ever since continued to meet there every
sessions of parliament, except when summoned
by the King’s writs to Oxford,
and it is now generally called the House
of Commons.</p>

<p class='c030'>It is at present a spacious room wainscotted
up to the ceiling, accommodated
with galleries, supported by slender iron
pillars adorned with Corinthian capitals
and sconces, from the middle of the
ceiling hangs a handsome branch or
lustre. At the upper end, the Speaker
is placed upon a raised seat, ornamented
behind with Corinthian columns, and
the King’s arms carved and placed on a
pediment; before him is a table, at
which the Clerk and his Assistant sit
near him on each hand, just below the
chair; and on each side, as well below
as in the galleries, the members are
placed promiscuously. The Speaker and
clerks always wear gowns in the house,
as the professors of the law do in term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>time; but no other of the members
wear robes, except the four representatives
for the city of London, who, the
first day of every new parliament, are
dressed in scarlet gowns, and sit all together
on the right hand of the chair,
next to the Speaker.</p>

<p class='c030'>The time of sitting is upon any day
in the morning, except on Sundays, or
some other high festivals or fast days,
upon which it is not usual to assemble,
unless upon the most urgent occasions:
but tho’ the Speaker always adjourns the
house to nine o’clock of the morning of
the day when they agree to meet again,
the house seldom meets till twelve.</p>

<p class='c030'>This house has an equal share with
the Lords in making laws, and none
can be made without the consent of
the Commons, who are the guardians
of the liberties of the people; and as
they are the grand inquest of the nation,
they have a power to impeach the greatest
Lords in the kingdom, both spiritual
and temporal.</p>

<p class='c030'>On the day prefixed by the King in
the writ of summons, his Majesty goes
in person to the house of Lords, where
being seated with the crown on his head,
and cloathed in his royal robes, he sends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>for the Commons by the Gentleman
Usher of the black rod, who coming to
the bar of the house, bows, and advancing
a few steps, repeats this mark of
respect a second and a third time, saying,
“Gentlemen of the house of Commons,
the King commands this honourable
house to attend him immediately in
the house of Peers;” and then retiring
backwards, bowing, withdraws:
the Commons then immediately attend
his Majesty in the house of Lords, where
the Lord Chancellor or Keeper commands
them in the King’s name to chuse
a Speaker, upon which they return to
their own house. One of the members
then standing up in his place, and making
a short introductory speech, moves
that such member as he then names,
may take the chair, and his motion being
seconded by some other member, if
no contest happens, they lead the person
mentioned from his seat to the bar of
the house, from whence they conduct
him bowing thrice, up the chair; where
being placed, he stands up, and returns
thanks to the house for the honour done
him, and modestly acknowledging his
inability to discharge so great a trust, desires
they would make choice of a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>*able person, which being disapproved,
he submits to their pleasure; and after
receiving the directions of the house, on
the usual requests to be made on his appearing
before his Majesty, adjourns to
the day appointed for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c030'>But before the Commons can enter
upon any business, or even the choice of
a Speaker, all the members enter the
court of wards, where they take the
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, with
those appointed by the act of the 1st of
William and Mary, in the presence of
an officer appointed by his Majesty, who
is usually the Lord Steward of the houshold;
and after they have chosen the
Speaker, they take the same oaths again
in the house, at the table, and subscribe
their opinions against the doctrines of
transubstantiation, the invocation and
adoration of Saints, and the sacrifice of
the mass; and before they can give any
vote in the house, except for the choice
of a Speaker, they are obliged also to
abjure the Pretender.</p>

<p class='c030'>Upon the day appointed, the Usher of
the black rod is again sent for the Commons,
when he alters his stile, and addresses
himself to the Speaker. The
members, obeying this summons, return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to the house of Lords, and present their
Speaker to the King, who is again seated
on the throne, and having obtained
his approbation, the Speaker desires, that
the Commons, during their sitting, “may
have free access to his Majesty, freedom
of speech in their own house, and
freedom from arrests.” After which
the King makes his speech to both
houses, the whole house of Commons
being supposed to be at the bar of the
house of Lords.</p>

<p class='c030'>After the Speaker and members have
taken the oaths, the standing orders of
the house are read, and grand committees
appointed to sit on usual days: which
being done, the house generally begins
with reading some bill left unfinished the
sessions before. Any member of parliament
is at liberty to move for a bill to
be brought in; which being agreed to
by the house, the person who made the
motion, with some of those who seconded
it, are ordered to prepare, and bring it
in. When the bill is ready, some of
the members who were ordered to prepare
it, read the order at the side bar of
the house, desiring leave to bring the
bill to the table; which upon the question
being agreed to, it has a first reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>by the clerk at the table; and then
the Speaker taking the bill in his hand,
reads the abbreviate or abstract of it:
which one, after the debate upon the
bill, if any happens, he puts the question,
Whether it shall have a second reading;
and sometimes upon a motion being
made appoints a day for it.</p>

<p class='c030'>When the bill has been read a second
time, the question is put, Whether it shall
be committed, which is either to a committee
of the whole house, if the bill be
of importance; or to a private committee,
any member at pleasure naming the persons
to be of that committee; and their
names being read by the clerk at the
table, they are ordered to meet in the
Speaker’s chamber, and report their
opinion to the house. Accordingly meeting
there, they chuse their Chairman,
and either adjourn to some other time,
or proceed upon the bill, which in this
last case, the Chairman orders a clerk
who attends them to read, then taking
the bill himself, and reading it paragraph
by paragraph, he puts every clause
to the question, fills up the blanks, and
makes amendments according to the
opinion of the majority of the committee,
of whom there must be eight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the persons named, to proceed regularly,
though five may adjourn.</p>

<p class='c030'>When the committee have gone
through the whole bill, the Chairman
by their desire makes his report at the
side bar of the house, reading all the alterations
made by the committee, and
how any of these amendments have altered
the scope of the bill, the clerk
having before written down in what
page and line of the bill those amendments
are to be found; and if the
committee have thought fit to add any
clauses, they are marked alphabetically,
read by the Chairman, and delivered to
the clerk, who reads all the amendments
and clauses. The Speaker then
puts the question, Whether they shall
be read a second time, and if this be agreed
to, he then reads them himself,
and particularly as many of them as the
house agrees to. After which the question
is put, Whether the bill so amended
shall be engrossed, that is, written
fair on parchment; and read the third
time some other day. It being at length
read the third time, the Speaker holds
the bill in his hand, and puts the question,
Whether the bill shall pass, and if
the major part be for it, the clerk writes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>on the bill <i>Soit baillé aux Seigneurs</i>, i. e.
Be it delivered to the Lords.</p>

<p class='c030'>When an engrossed bill is read, and
any clauses referred to be added to it,
they must be on parchment engrossed
like the bill, which are then called <i>riders</i>;
and if agreed to, they are added
to the bill.</p>

<p class='c030'>Petitions are offered like bills at the
bar of the house, and brought up and
delivered at the table, by the member
who presents them.</p>

<p class='c030'>When a member speaks to a bill, he
stands up uncovered, and addresses himself
only to the Speaker; but if he be
answered by another, he is not allowed
to reply the same day, unless personally
reflected on: for nobody is to speak to a
bill above once in a day, unless the whole
house be turned into a committee, and
then every number may reply as often
as the Chairman thinks proper. But if
a bill be rejected, it cannot be any more
proposed, during the same sessions.</p>

<p class='c030'>Messengers from the Lords, and all
persons appearing at the bar of the house,
are introduced by the serjeant attending
the house, with the mace upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>While the Speaker is in the chair, the
mace lies upon the table, except when
sent upon any extraordinary occasion into
Westminster hall and the court of
requests, to summon the members to
attend. But when the members resolve
themselves into a committee of the whole
house, the mace is laid under the table,
and the Chairman to that committee takes
the chair where the clerk of the house
usually sits.</p>

<p class='c030'>Forty members are necessary to make
a house, and eight a committee. But
the Speaker is not allowed to vote, except
the house be equally divided: nor
is he to persuade or dissuade in passing a
bill; but only to make a short and plain
narrative.</p>

<p class='c030'>The members of the house of Commons
vote by yeas and noes; but if it
appear doubtful which is the greater
number, the house divides. If the question
relates to any thing already in the
house, the noes go out; but if it be to
bring any thing in, as a bill, petition,
&amp;c. the ayes go out: where the house
divides, the Speaker appoints four tellers,
two of each opinion, who after they have
told those within, place themselves in
the passage between the bar and the door,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>and tell the others who went out; which
done, the two tellers who have the majority
take the right hand, and placing
themselves within the bar, all four advance
bowing three times; and being
come up to the table deliver the number,
saying, the ayes who went out, are so
many; the noes who staid, so many;
or the contrary: which is repeated by
the Speaker, who declares the majority.</p>

<p class='c030'>In a committee of the whole house,
they divide by changing sides, the ayes
taking the right hand of the chair, and
the noes the left; and then there are
only two tellers.</p>

<p class='c030'>If when a bill is passed in one house,
and sent to the other, they demur upon
it; a conference is then demanded in
the Painted Chamber, where certain
members deputed from each house meet,
and debate the affair, while the Lords sit
covered at a table, and the Commons
stand without their hats. If they disagree,
the affair is dropped; but if they
come to an agreement, it is at length
brought, with all the other bills that
have passed both houses, to receive the
royal assent, in the house, where the
King being seated in the chair of state,
the Clerk of the crown reads the title
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of each bill; and as he reads, the Clerk
of the Parliament, according to the
instructions he hath received from his
Majesty, pronounces the royal assent;
if it be a public bill by saying, <i>Le Roy
le veut</i>, <i>i. e.</i> The King will have it so;
or if a private bill, <i>Soit fait comme il est
désiré</i>; <i>i. e.</i> Be it done as is desired. But if
his Majesty does not approve the bill, the
answer is, <i>Le Roy s’avisera</i>: that is, The
King will consider of it.</p>

<p class='c030'>Money bills always begin in the house
of Commons; because the greatest part
of the supplies are raised by the people,
and for this reason the Commons
will not allow the Lords to alter them;
and on the presenting these bills to his
Majesty, the answer is, <i>Le Roy remercie
ses loyaux sujets, accepte leur benevolence,
&amp; aussi le veut</i>: that is, The King
thanks his loyal subjects, accepts of their
benevolence, and therefore grants his
consent.</p>

<p class='c030'>A bill for a general pardon has but one
reading in each house; because they
must take it as the King will please to
give it: and when this bill is passed,
the answer is, <i>Les Prélats, Seigneurs, &amp;
Communes, en ce parlement assemblez, au
nom du tous vos autre sujets, remercient</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span><i>très humblement vôtre Majesté, &amp; prient
Dieu vous donner en santé, bonne vie &amp;
longue</i>: that is, The Bishops, Lords,
and Commons in this Parliament assembled,
in the name of all your other subjects,
most humbly thank your Majesty,
and beseech God to grant you a long
and healthful life.</p>

<p class='c030'>The King, without his personal presence,
may, by a commission granted
to some of his Nobles, give his royal
assent to any bill that requires haste.</p>

<p class='c030'>When his Majesty prorogues or dissolves
the Parliament, he generally comes in
person, and being seated with the crown on
his head, sends the Black Rod for all the
house of Commons to come to the bar
of the house of Lords; and then the
speech being read by the Lord Chancellor,
he, by the King’s special command,
pronounces the Parliament prorogued
or dissolved.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Parliament was formerly dissolved
at the death of the King; but to prevent
tumults and confusion, it is now
expressly provided by a solemn act, That
a Parliament sitting, or in being at the
King’s demise, shall continue; and if not
sitting shall meet expressly, for keeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the peace of the realm, and preserving
the succession. See <i>House of</i> <span class='sc'>Lords</span>.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Compters</span>, two prisons, for the confinement
of all who are arrested within the
city and liberties; one in the Poultry,
belonging to one of the Sheriffs of London,
and another in Wood street, Cheapside,
which belongs to the other Sheriff.
Both these prisons are of the same nature,
and have the like officers, each
being a place of security both for debtors
and criminals.</p>

<p class='c030'>Under the Sheriffs there are the following
officers in each Compter, who
give security to the Sheriff, for the faithful
discharge of their respective trusts.</p>

<p class='c030'>I. The principal officer, next to the
Sheriff, is the Secondary, who returns
writs, marks warrants, and impannels
juries for the courts both above and
below, and also for the sessions.</p>

<p class='c030'>II. The Clerk of the Papers: whose
office is to impannel juries, for the Sheriffs
court; and who enters upon judgment,
and makes out all processes for the
Sheriffs court.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>III. Four Clerks Sitters, who enter
actions, take bail, receive verdicts after
trial, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c030'>IV. Sixteen Serjeants at mace, each
of whom has his yeoman, or follower.
Their office is to arrest persons for debt,
to execute all processes, to serve writs,
executions upon actions, and summonses
from above, as well as from the courts
below. Each of these serjeants give
400<i>l.</i> security to the Sheriff, for the
due execution of his office. Four of
these serjeants, and as many yeomen
out of each Compter, wait upon their
respective Sheriffs daily; and during the
time of sessions, double the number. At
which time in the morning they bring
the prisoners down from Newgate to
the sessions house; put them in the
dock; and after waiting all day, return
the prisoners back to the jail at night:
they also attend at the execution of prisoners.
Upon their days of waiting,
they always wear blue cloth gowns,
which are given them annually by the
Sheriffs.</p>

<p class='c030'>To each Compter also belong a
Master keeper, two turnkeys, and
other servants.</p>

<p class='c030'>The prisoners in the common side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>in both Compters, receive daily relief
from the Sheriffs table, of all the broken
meat and bread; and there are also several
benefactions made by charitable persons,
settled upon the Compters for their relief.

<p class='c025'><i>Court of</i> <span class='sc'>Conscience</span>, also called the

the reign of Henry VIII. by an act of
Common Council, for the recovery of
small debts, under the value of 40<i>s.</i> and
has since been confirmed by several acts
of parliament. It is of great use to such
poor debtors as are not able to pay their
debts immediately; and also of great benefit
to such poor persons as have small
debts owing to them, and are unable to
enter into a more expensive suit. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Lord Mayor and court of Aldermen appoint
monthly such Aldermen and Commoners
to sit as Commissioners in this
court as they think fit, and these, or any
three of them, compose a court, kept in
Guildhall every Wednesday and Saturday,
from eleven till two o’clock, to hear
and determine such causes as are brought
before them. They have the power of
administering an oath to the creditor, of
examining witnesses, and of making such
orders between the plaintiff and defendant,
the creditor and debtor, as they
think most agreeable to equity and conscience;
and if the debtor be unable to
pay the whole sum at once, they appoint
it to be paid monthly in such proportions
as they judge to be in his power; but if
he neglects paying monthly into court
the small sums appointed, he may be
served with an execution, and carried to
prison; or if the person cannot be found,
his goods may be seized.</p>

<p class='c030'>A cause may be brought and determined
in this court for the value of 10<i>d</i>.
viz. 6<i>d</i>. for the plaint and summons, and
4<i>d</i>. for the order; but if the defendant
does not appear the second court day
after the summons, an attachment may
be awarded against him.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>If any citizen shall be arrested for a
debt under 40<i>s.</i> this court will grant a
summons for the plaintiff in the action;
and if he does not appear on the first
court day after the summons is left at his
house, the court will grant an attachment
against him, force him to take his
debt, and pay the defendant his costs;
and if any attorney in London shall presume
to proceed in any such suit, after
notice to the contrary, or shall refuse to
obey the order of this court, upon complaint
thereof to the court of Aldermen,
they will suspend such person from his
practice.</p>

<p class='c030'>The fees taken by the clerks of the
court of conscience at Guildhall are as
follow: For every plaint 2<i>d</i>. For every
appearance 2<i>d</i>. For every order 4<i>d</i>. For
every remittance to the common law 4<i>d</i>.
For every precept or warrant to commit
to prison 6<i>d</i>. For every search 2<i>d</i>. For

the liberties 6<i>d</i>. For serving any precept

<p class='c030'>Mr. Stow observes, that King Richard
II. marrying the daughter of Wenceslaus
King of Bohemia, the English
by her example wore long peaked shoes
tied to their knees with silk laces, or
silver chains gilt. This preposterous fashion
occasioned the passing of an act of

with an elegant vase placed over each

who is to enquire into the causes of all
sudden deaths, where there is the least

he impannels a jury, to whom he

oath. The Lord Mayor for the time
being is coroner of the city; but he appoints
a deputy for the discharge of
that office. The coroner’s jury have a
right to examine the body of the deceased,
and to call in the assistance of
physicians or surgeons. They are to try
the supposed murderer; and if they acquit
him of all guilt, and concern in the
death of the deceased, he is set at liberty;
but if they find him guilty, their
sentence is not final; the supposed murderer
being sent to prison to take his
trial at the Old Bailey. The coroner is

read in antiquities; but on the 23d of
October 1731, this valuable collection
suffered greatly by fire; by which ninety
nine volumes were destroyed, and an
hundred and eleven much damaged.</p>

<p class='c030'>Before this misfortune, the Cotton
library consisted of 958 volumes of original
charters, grants, instruments, registers
of monasteries, remains of Saxon
laws; the letters of Sovereign Princes,
transactions between this and other kingdoms
and states, the book of Genesis,
said to have been written by Origen, in
the second century, and to be the most
ancient Greek copy extant; and the curious
Alexandrean manuscript of the Old
and New Testament, in Greek capitals,
said to have been written in the third
century.</p>

<p class='c030'>For the care of this library, seven
trustees were appointed, viz. the Lord
Chancellor, or Keeper, the Speaker of
the house of Commons, and the Lord
Chief Justice of the court of King’s
Bench, for the time being; with four
others, nominated by the heir male of
the Cotton family. The books were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>deposited in the Old Dormitory at Westminster,
but agreeably to a late act of
parliament they are now placed with
Sir Hans Sloane’s Museum in Montague
House, Bloomsbury. See the article
<span class='sc'>British Museum</span>.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Covely’s</span> <i>alley</i>, Grey Eagle street, Spitalfields.†</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Covent Garden</span>, received its name from
its being formerly a garden belonging to
the Abbot and Monks of the convent of
Westminster, whence it was called Convent
Garden, of which the present name
is a corruption. At the dissolution of
religious houses it fell to the Crown, and
was given first to Edward Duke of Somerset;
but soon after, upon his attainder,
it reverted again to the Crown, and
Edward VI. granted it in 1552 to John
Earl of Bedford, together with a field,
named the Seven Acres, which being
now built into a street, is from its length
called Long Acre.</p>

<p class='c030'>Covent Garden would have been without
dispute one of the finest squares
in Europe, had it been finished on
the plan designed for it, by that excellent
architect Inigo Jones. The piazza
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is grand and noble; besides the convenience
of walking dry under it in wet
weather, the superstructure it supports
is light and elegant. In the middle
is a handsome column supporting four sun
dials, and on the west side of the square,
is the church, erected by Inigo Jones, and
esteemed by the best judges one of the
most simple, and at the same time most
perfect pieces of architecture, that the
art of man can produce. But the market
before it diminishes the beauty of
the square.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Covent Garden</span> <i>Church</i>, was erected
in the year 1640, as a chapel of ease to
St. Martin’s in the Fields, at the expence
of Francis Earl of Bedford, for
the convenience of his tenants, who
were then vastly increased.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church is remarkable for its majestic
simplicity, and the gates on each
side are suitable to the structure and very
elegant. This church never fails to attract
the eye of the most incurious, and,
as we observed before, if Inigo Jones’s
original design had been compleated, it
would have had a most noble effect.</p>

<p><i>Covent Garden.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>In 1645, the precinct of Covent Garden
was separated from St. Martin’s,
and constituted an independent parish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>which was confirmed after the restoration
in 1660, by the appellation of St.
Paul’s Covent Garden, when the patronage
was vested in the Earl of Bedford:
and as it escaped the fire in 1666, which
did not reach so far, it remains as it
came from the hands of the great architect.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the front is a plain, but noble portico
of the Tuscan order, executed in
the most masterly manner; the columns
are massy, and the intercolumniation
large, which has an air of noble simplicity,
that if compared with the most
ornamented Gothic structures, shews the
superiority of the Roman architecture
in its plainest form, over the finest barbarism.
The building, tho’ as plain
as possible, is happily proportioned; the
walls are of brick covered with plaister,
and the corners of stone; the roof is
flat, and though of great extent, is
supported by the walls alone, without
columns. The pavement is stone;
the windows are of the Tuscan form
like the portico, and the altar piece is
adorned with eight fluted columns of
the Corinthian order, painted in imitation
of porphyry. But this by some is
thought a defect, the lightness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>altar piece in their opinion giving the
church an air of heaviness.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Cray.</span> There are several villages of this
name in Kent, situated on the small river
Cray, from which they take their names.
This stream rises a little to the south
west of St. Mary Cray, runs by that
town, and passing by Paul’s Cray, Foot’s
Cray, and North Cray, runs into the Darent,
near its conflux with the Thames
at Dartford creek, opposite to Purfleet.
The principal of these places is St.
Mary Cray, about which are many woods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of birch, from which the broom-makers
in Kent street, Southwark, are supplied.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Crayford</span>, a town near Dartford in Kent,
is 14 miles from London, and obtained
its name from its having anciently a ford
over the river Cray, or Crouch, a little
above its influx into the Thames. In
the adjacent heath and fields are several
caves, supposed to have been formed by
the Saxons as places of security and shelter
for their wives, children, and effects,
during their wars with the Britons.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Cripplegate</span>, so named from some cripples
who anciently begged there, appears
to have been one of the original gates of
the city, and is situated 1032 feet to the west
of Moorgate. It has been many times
rebuilt, but the present structure, which
was repaired in 1663, seems to have
stood between two and three hundred
years. It is a very plain solid edifice,
void of all ornament. It has only one
postern, and has more the appearance of
a fortification than any of the others.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Cripplegate Ward</span>, is very large, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>consists of two parts, one lying within
Cripplegate and London Wall, and the
other reaching to the extent of the city
liberties. The whole ward extends from
Cheapside on the south, to beyond Bridgewater
square in the north; and from
Jewin street in the west, to Back street,
Moorfields, in the east; it being bounded
on the north by the parish of St.
Luke, without the freedom; on the
west by Aldersgate ward; on the south
by Cheap ward; and on the east, by
little Moorfields, part of Coleman street
ward, Bassishaw ward, and Cheap ward.</p>

<p class='c030'>The principal streets, &amp;c. within the
walls are, Milk street, Aldermanbury,
Love lane, Wood street, Silver street, Addle
street, and a very small part of Cheapside,
containing 170 feet eastward from
Wood street. The chief places without
the walls are, Fore street, Moor lane,
Whitecross street to beyond Beech lane,
Redcross street, Beech lane, part of Barbican,
and all Bridgewater square.</p>

<p class='c030'>The principal buildings in this ward
are the parish churches of St. Giles Cripplegate,
St. Alphage, St. Alban’s Wood
street, St. Michael’s Woodstreet, and
St. Mary Aldermanbury; Lamb’s chapel,
Sion college, Dr. Williams’s Library;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>and the halls of the Haberdashers,
Waxchandlers, Plaisterers,  Brewers,
Curriers, Bowyers, and Loriners companies.</p>

<p class='c030'>This ward is governed by an Alderman,
and within the gate are
eight Common Council men, fifteen
wardmote inquest men, twelve scavengers,
nine constables, and a beadle.
Without the gate there are four Common
Council, seventeen wardmote inquest
men, four scavengers, two constables,
and a beadle. The jurymen returned
by the wardmote inquest serve
in the several courts in Guildhall in the
month of March.</p>

’Tis said there was once a royal
palace in this place, which was given
with the manor to the Archbishops of
Canterbury, who converted it into a
palace for themselves; but it is now
much decayed. Archbishop Whitgift
founded an hospital here, which he endowed
with farms for the support of a
warden, and twenty-eight men and women,
decayed house-keepers of Croydon
and Lambeth, with a school for ten boys,
and as many girls, with 20<i>l.</i> a year and
a house for the master, who must be
a clergyman. The church, which is
esteemed the finest and largest in the
county, has several stately monuments,
particularly one for Archbishop Grindall,
another for Archbishop Sheldon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>another for Mr. Francis Tyrrel, a grocer
in London, who generously gave 200<i>l.</i>
to build the market house. Here is a
great corn market on Saturdays, chiefly
for oats and oatmeal for the service of
London; and the adjacent hills being
well covered with wood, great quantities
of charcoal are made and sent to
this city.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Crutched Friars.</span> This street took its
name from a monastery of the Holy
Cross at the south east corner of Hart
street, near Tower hill. This monastery
was founded about the year 1298, and
continued till the suppression of the other
religious houses. In the reign of Henry
VIII. a Prior of this house being found
in bed with a whore in the day time, by
the Visitors appointed by the Lord Cromwell,
he distributed thirty pounds among
them, and promised them as much more;
an account of which being sent by the
Visitors to Cromwell, these scandalous
crimes hastened the dissolution of monasteries.
The ruins of this religious house
are not now to be seen, and nothing of
it remains but the name, which is given
to the street, that is more commonly
called Crutched Friars, than Hart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>street. In the place where the monastery
stood, is now erected the Navy
office, and many other handsome buildings.</p>

<p class='c025'><i>The</i> <span class='sc'>Custom House</span>, a commodious
building, erected for the receipt of his
Majesty’s customs on goods imported and
exported. It is situated near the east end of
Thames street, and its front opens to the
wharfs and rivers. In ancient times the business
of the Custom House was transacted
in a more irregular manner at Billingsgate:
but in the reign of Queen Elizabeth
a building was erected here for this
purpose; for in the year 1559, an act
being passed that goods should be no
where landed, but in such places as
were appointed by the Commissioners
of the revenue, this was the spot fixed
upon for the entries in the port of London,
and here a Custom House was ordered to
be erected; it was however destroyed
by fire with the rest of the city in 1666,
and was rebuilt with additions two
years after by King Charles II. in a
much more magnificent and commodious
manner, at the expence of 10,000<i>l.</i>
but that being also destroyed in the same
manner in 1718, the present structure
was erected in its place.</p>

<p><i>Custom House.</i><br /><i>S. Wale delin.</i>      <i>B. Green sc. Oxon.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>This edifice is built with brick and
stone, and is calculated to stand for ages.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>It has underneath and on each side, large
warehouses for the reception of goods on
the public account, and that side of the
Thames for a great extent is filled with
wharfs, keys, and cranes for landing
them. The Custom House is 189 feet
in length: the center is twenty-seven
feet deep, and the wings considerably
more. The center stands back from
the river; the wings approach much
nearer to it, and the building is judiciously
and handsomely decorated with the
orders of architecture: under the wings
is a colonade of the Tuscan order, and
the upper story is ornamented with
Ionic columns and pediments. It consists
of two floors, in the uppermost of
which is a magnificent room fifteen feet
high, that runs almost the whole length
of the building: this is called the Long
Room, and here sit the Commissioners
of the customs, with their officers and
clerks. The inner part is well disposed,
and sufficiently enlightened; and the
entrances are so well contrived, as to
answer all the purposes of convenience.</p>

<p class='c030'>Though we cannot call this a very beautiful
building, yet from its great utility,
and the conspicuous place in which it
stands, we thought a representation of
it by a print could not be omitted.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>It is observable that in the year 1590,
the customs and subsidies in the port of
London inwards, were let to farm to
Mr. Thomas Smith, for 20,000<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, when it was discovered that they
amounted annually to 30309<i>l.</i> so that
Queen Elizabeth lost every year 10,309<i>l.</i>
but by the vast increase of commerce
since that time, they at present bring in
above an hundred times as much, the
customs now annually amounting to above
two millions, and yet this immense
business is transacted with as much order
and regularity, as the common affairs
of a merchant’s counting house.</p>

<p class='c030'>The government of the Custom House
is under the care of nine Commissioners,
who are entrusted with the whole management
of all his Majesty’s customs in
all the ports of England, the petty
farms excepted, and also the oversight
of all the officers belonging to them.
Each of these Commissioners has a salary
of 1000<i>l.</i> a year, and both they, and
several of the principal officers under
them, hold their places by patent from
the King. The other officers are appointed
by warrant from the Lords of
the Treasury.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span><span class='sc'>Darking</span>, a town in Surry, situated on a
branch of the Mole, a little before it runs
under ground. This town, which is very
ancient, is 24 miles from London. It
was destroyed by the Danes, but was
rebuilt either by Canute or the Normans;
and the great Roman causeway
called Stony Street passes through the
church yard. This place is famous for
its meal trade, and its market for poultry,
particularly for the largest geese and
the fattest capons, which are brought hither
from Horsham in Sussex; and the
whole business of the people for many
miles, consists in breeding and fattening
them. Its market is on Thursdays, and
its fair on Holy Thursday is the greatest
in England for lambs. It is remarkable,
that according to a custom of the manor,
the youngest son or youngest brother of
a customary tenant, is heir of the customary
estate of the tenant dying intestate.
Near the town is a heath, called
the Cottman Dean, (i. e. the heath
of poor cottages) on which stands their
almshouse; and that heath, in the opinion
of some learned physicians, has the
best air in England.</p>

<p class='c030'>Near this town stands Mr. Howard’s
house and gardens called Deepden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>situated in a small valley on every side
surrounded with hills. The level ground
about the house was laid out into pleasant
walks and gardens, planted with a
great variety of exotic trees and plants,
and the hills planted with trees, except
on the south aspect, which was covered
with vines. But both the gardens and
vineyard, though the latter has produced
good wine, have been neglected, and
many of the exotic trees have been destroyed.
On the top of the hill, above
the vineyard, is a summer house, from
which, in a clear day, the sea may be
discerned over the south downs.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Dartford</span>, a town in Kent, sixteen miles
from London, is more properly called
<i>Darentford</i>, from its being situated on
the river Darent, which runs through
it, and at a small distance falls into the
Thames. The town has a harbour for
barges, and is finely watered by two or
three good springs. King Edward III.
had a general tournament performed
here by his nobles, and also here founded
a convent, whose abbess and nuns
were, for the most part, of the noblest
families in the kingdom; and this convent
King Henry VIII. turned into a
palace. Henry VI. founded an almshouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>here in honour of the Trinity, to
which the church is dedicated, for five
poor decrepid men, to be governed by
the Vicar and Wardens, who were constituted
a body corporate, with a common
seal, and a power to assign lands
and rents to the hospital, to the value of
20<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>. On this river the first
paper mill in England was erected by Sir
John Spilman, who obtained a patent
and 200<i>l.</i> a year from King Charles I.
to enable him to carry on that manufacture:
and on this river was also the
first mill for slitting iron bars for making
wire. The town is full of inns and
other public houses, on account of its
being a great thoroughfare to Canterbury
and Dover. The market, which
is on Saturdays, is chiefly for corn, and
the town has the honour of giving the
title of Viscount to the Earl of Jersey.</p>

the spiritual courts; for upon the abolishing
of the papal power within this kingdom
by Henry VIII. in the year 1534, it
was enacted by parliament, that no appeals
should from thenceforward be
made to Rome; but in default of justice
in any of the spiritual courts, the
party aggrieved might appeal to the King
in his court of Chancery; upon which a
commission under the great seal should
be directed to such persons as his Majesty
should think fit to nominate. These
Commissioners to whom the King thus
delegates his power, generally consist of
Noblemen, Bishops, and Judges, both of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the common and civil law; and as this
court is not fixed, but occasional, these
Commissioners, or Delegates, are varied
at the pleasure of the Lord Chancellor,
who appoints them.  No appeals lie
from this court; but upon good reasons
assigned, the Lord Chancellor may grant
a commission of review.</p>

is said to have received its present
name from its having a deep ford over
the little river Ravensbourn, near its influx
into the Thames, where it has now a
bridge. It is a large and populous town
in Kent, four miles and a half from London,
and is divided into Upper and Lower
Deptford, which contain together two
churches, several meeting houses, and
about 1900 houses. It is most remarkable
for its noble dock, where the royal
navy was formerly built and repaired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>till it was found more convenient to build
the larger ships at Woolwich, and other
places, where there is a greater depth of
water: but notwithstanding this, the
yard is enlarged to more than double its
former dimensions, and a vast number
of hands are constantly employed. It
has a wet dock of two acres for ships,
and another of an acre and a half, with
vast quantities of timber and other stores,
and extensive buildings, as storehouses,
and offices, for the use of the place, besides
dwelling houses for those officers
who are obliged to live upon the spot, in
order to superintend the works. Here
the royal yachts are generally kept,
and near the dock is the seat of Sir John
Evelyn, called Say’s Court, where Peter
the Great, Czar of Muscovy, resided for
some time, and in this yard completed
his knowledge and skill in the practical
part of naval architecture.</p>

<p class='c030'>In this town are two hospitals, one
of which was incorporated by King Henry
VIII. in the form of a college, for the
use of the seamen, and is commonly called
<i>Trinity House</i> of Deptford Strond;
this contains twenty-one houses, and is
situated near the church. The other
called <i>Trinity Hospital</i>, has thirty-eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>houses fronting the street. This is a very
handsome edifice, and has large gardens
well kept belonging to it. Though this
last is the finest structure, yet the other
has the preference, on account of its antiquity;
and as the Brethren of the Trinity
hold their corporation by that house,
they are obliged at certain times to meet
there for business. Both these houses are
for decayed pilots or masters of ships, or
their widows, the men being allowed
20<i>s.</i> and the women 16<i>s.</i> a month. For
a particular account of the corporation
called the Brothers of the Trinity, see the

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Devonshire House</span>, in Piccadilly, is
the residence of his Grace the Duke of
Devonshire when in London. The
house is built principally of brick, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>though plain is very elegant and well
proportioned, and the rooms of state are
very rich and magnificent. The offices
on each side are properly subordinate to
the house, so as to make a consistent
whole. The collection of pictures, with
which this house is adorned, is surpassed
by very few either at home or abroad;

came to Henry Duke of Norfolk, from whose
steward Mr. Fox, it was bought by Mr. Sykes, who
afterwards sold it to the Duke of Devonshire, 1722.</p>

<p class='c032'>The tradition concerning it was, that King
Henry V. received it as a present, about a year
before his death, from the famous John Duke
of Bedford then Regent of England, and afterwards
Regent of France in the reign of Henry VI. The
Duke of Bedford bespoke it of John Van Eyck
the painter, who invented the art of painting in oil.
Thomas a Becket, whose consecration this painting
is supposed to represent, was the favourite
saint of King Henry V.</p>

Here was formerly a very large and fine

of his being a man of no great

debt, was called in derision, Fisher’s
Folly; this house afterwards belonged
to the Earl of Oxford, and lastly to the

an Athenian <i>Areopagite</i>, or Judge,
who being converted on St. Paul’s preaching
at Athens, became the first Bishop of
that city, and at length Patron of France.
This is the celebrated Saint, who, according
to the absurd and ridiculous fables
of the Papists, carried his head two
miles after it was cut off. The epithet
of Backchurch, was given to this edifice
from its situation behind a row of houses,
to distinguish it from St. Gabriel’s church,
which stood in the middle of Fenchurch
street. The old church was destroyed
by the great fire in 1666, and the present
edifice, which is built with stone,
was erected in its room.</p>

offices in which wills are deposited and
searched, and a court of faculties and

<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Knight Rider street, near the College of
Arms, on the south side of St. Paul’s
Cathedral. The old building which
stood in this place was purchased for the
residence of the Civilians and Canonists,
by Henry Harvey, Doctor of the civil and
canon law, and Dean of the Arches;
but this edifice being destroyed by the
general devastation in 1666, they removed
to Exeter House in the Strand,
where the Civilians had their chambers
and offices; and the courts were kept
in the hall; but some years after the
Commons being rebuilt in a far more
convenient and sumptuous manner than
before, the Civilians returned thither.</p>

<p class='c030'>The causes of which the civil and
ecclesiastical law do, or may take cognizance,
are blasphemy, apostasy from
Christianity, heresy, ordinations, institutions
of clerks to benefices, celebration
of divine service, matrimony, divorces,
bastardy, tithes, oblations, obventions,
mortuaries, dilapidations, reparation
of churches, probate of wills, administrations,
simony, incest, fornication,
adultery, solicitation of chastity, pensions,
procurations, commutation of penance,
right of pews, and others of the
like kind.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The practisers in these courts, are of
two sorts, Advocates and Proctors. The
<i>Advocates</i> are such as have taken the degree
of Doctor of the civil law, and are
retained as counsellors or pleaders. These
must first upon their petition to the Archbishop,
obtain his <i>fiat</i>; and then they
are admitted by the Judge to practise.
The manner of their admission is solemn.
Two senior Advocates in their scarlet
robes, with the mace carried before
them, conduct the Doctor up the court
with three reverences, and present him
with a short Latin speech, together with
the Archbishop’s rescript; and then having
taken the oaths, the Judge admits
him, and assigns him a place or seat in
the court, which he is always to keep
when he pleads. Both the Judge and
Advocates, if of Oxford, wear in court
scarlet robes, and hoods lined with taffata;
but if of Cambridge, white minever,
and round black velvet caps.</p>

<p class='c030'>The <i>Proctors</i>, or <i>Procurators</i>, exhibit
their proxies for their clients; and make
themselves parties for them, and draw
and give pleas, or libels and allegations,
in their behalf; produce witnesses, prepare
causes for sentence, and attend the
Advocates with the proceedings. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>are also admitted by the Archbishop’s
<i>fiat</i>, and introduced by two senior Proctors.
They wear black robes and hoods
lined with fur.</p>

<p class='c030'>The terms for the pleading and ending
of causes in the civil courts, are but
little different from the term times of the
common law. The order as to the time
of the sitting of the several courts, is as
follows. The court of Arches having the
pre-eminence, sits first in the morning.
The court of Admiralty sits in the afternoon
on the same day; and the Prerogative
court also sits in the afternoon. See
<span class='sc'>Arches</span>, <span class='sc'>Prerogative</span> <i>court</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Doctors Commons Library.</span> This is
a spacious room, containing a great
number of books of all sorts, more particularly
on civil law and history. It
was greatly increased by the addition of
the whole library of Sir John Gibson,
Judge of the Prerogative Office, given by
James Gibson, Esq; one of his descendants;
and it must be continually improving,
as every Bishop, at his consecration,
gives at least 20<i>l.</i> and some 50,
towards purchasing books for it. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Drapers Hall</span>, situated on the south
side of Throgmorton street, is built upon
the ruins of a noble palace erected
on that spot, in the reign of King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Henry VIII. by Thomas Lord Cromwell,
Earl of Essex, which upon his attainder
and execution for high treason
devolving to the Crown, was purchased
by the Company of Drapers, for the
use to which it is now applied: but was
burnt in the fire of London in 1666,
and has been since rebuilt in a very handsome
manner.</p>

<p class='c030'>This is a spacious and noble edifice,
which composes the four sides of a quadrangle,
each of which is elevated on
columns and adorned with arches, forming
a piazza round a square court, and
between each arch is a shield, mantling,
and other fretwork. The room called
the hall is adorned with a stately screen,
and fine wainscot; the pictures of King
William III. King George I. King
George II. at full length; and an ancient
picture, a three quarter length of
Henry Fitz-Alwine, a draper, and the
first Lord Mayor of London.</p>

<p class='c030'>There are also several other large rooms
wainscoted with oak; as the court room,
at the end of which hangs a valuable
picture of Mary Queen of Scots at full
length, with King James her infant
son in her hand. This leads into a long
gallery, at the south end of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>is a door into the apartments for the
clerk and offices: at the north end a
folding sash door opens into a grand
square room called the Ladies chamber,
where the company have been used at
certain seasons to entertain their wives
and friends with a ball. In the center
of this room hangs a large and beautiful
cut chandelier, which was a present from
the late Sir Joseph Eyles, when he served
the office of Sheriff: and over the
chimney piece is a fine picture of Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor of London.
Out of the west side of this room is
a passage that leads to a place called the
Record room; the door to which is of
iron; it is strongly built over the passage
that leads into the garden, and covered
with a cistern that contains such a body
of water as may at any time be sufficient
to defend this apartment from fire that
might spread from the adjacent buildings.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Drapers Gardens</span>, are pleasant and
commodious, though not very large.
They are situated behind the hall, and
being nearly square, have on each side
rows of lime trees which form very agreeable
walks. The middle part, which
is enclosed by iron rails, has several grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>plats bordered with beds of flowers, and
in the center is a statue of Flora. In
this part there are also several mulberry
trees. These gardens are open every
day in the week except Sundays, for all
persons decently dressed.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Dulwich</span>, a very pleasant village in Surry,
five miles from London, where there is
a spring of the same medicinal waters as
those of Sydenham wells, with which
the master of the Green Man, a house of
good entertainment, serves this city, and
in particular St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.
The fine walk opposite to this house,
through the woods, affords from its top
a very noble prospect; but this is much
exceeded by that from a hill behind the
house, where from under a tree distinguished
by the name of <i>The Oak of Honour</i>,
you have a view as in a fine piece
of painting, of the houses as well as
churches, and other public edifices, from
Putney down to Chelsea, with all the
adjacent villages, together with Westminster,
London, Deptford, and Greenwich,
and over the great metropolis, as far as
Highgate, and Hamstead. But Dulwich
is most famous for its college.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Dulwich College</span>, was founded and endowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in 1619, by Mr. William Alleyn,
who named it, <i>The college of God’s gift</i>.
This gentleman being a comedian and
principal actor in many of Shakespear’s
plays; once personating the devil, was
said to be so terrified at the opinion of
his seeing a real devil upon the stage,
that he from that moment quitted the
theatre, devoted the remainder of his
life to religious exercises, and founded
this college for a Master and Warden,
who were always to be of the name of
Alleyn, or Allen; with four Fellows,
three of whom were to be divines, and
the fourth an organist; and for six poor
men, as many poor women, and twelve
poor boys, to be educated in the college
by one of the fellows as schoolmaster,
and by another as usher. In his original
endowments, he excluded all future benefactions
to it, and constituted for visitors,
the churchwardens of St. Botolph’s
Bishopsgate, St. Giles’s Cripplegate, and
St. Saviour’s Southwark; who, upon
occasion, were to appeal to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, before whom all
the members were to be sworn at their
admission. To this college belongs a
chapel, in which the founder himself,
who was several years Master, lies buried.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>The Master of this college is Lord
of the manor, for a considerable extent
of ground, and enjoys all the luxurious
affluence and ease of the Prior
of a monastery. Both he and the Warden,
must be unmarried, and are for
ever debarred the privilege of entering
that state, on pain of being excluded
the college; but as the Warden always
succeeds upon the death of the
Master, great interest is constantly made,
by the unmarried men of the name of
Allen, to obtain the post of Warden.</p>

<p class='c030'>The original edifice is in the old
taste; but part of it has been lately pulled
down and rebuilt with greater elegance,
out of what has been saved from
the produce of the estate. The Master’s
rooms are richly adorned with very noble
old furniture, which he is obliged to purchase
on his entering into that station;
and for his use there is a library, to
which every Master generally adds a
number of books. The college is also
accommodated with a very pleasant garden,
adorned with walks, and a great
profusion of fruit trees and flowers.</p>

<p class='c025'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Dunstan’s</span> <i>in the East</i>, a church situated
on the west side of St. Dunstan’s
hill, Thames street, is dedicated to St.
Dunstan Archbishop of Canterbury, an
implacable enemy and cruel persecutor
of the secular clergy, in favour of the regulars;
and the additional epithet <i>the
East</i>, is given it, to distinguish it from
St. Dunstan’s in Fleet street. This
church was repaired at a great expence
in 1633, and in 1666 suffered greatly by
the fire of London; but not being totally
destroyed, the church was thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>repaired in eighteen months;
but the steeple was delayed ten years
longer. The style of the building is the
modern Gothic. It is 87 feet in length,
63 in breadth, and the roof is 33 feet
high; it is well enlightened, and agreeably
disposed within. The steeple is 125
feet high, and is well constructed in the
Gothic manner: the tower is light, supported
by outworks at the angles; it is
divided into three stages, and terminated
at the corners by four handsome pinacles,
in the midst of which rises the
spire, not from a solid base, but on the
narrow crowns of four Gothic arches, a
base so seemingly insecure, that it fills
the mind with apprehensions of its falling
with the first tempest, and yet is
perhaps able to stand for ages. This
tower, which is extremely light and
elegant, was built by Sir Christopher
Wren. The placing the spire on the
top of four arches, as the print shews,
is esteemed a bold attempt in architecture,
and is one proof, among many,
of the great geometrical skill of the architect.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church is a rectory, and one of

<p class='c025'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Dunstan’s</span> <i>in the West</i>, on the north
side of the west end of Fleet street, is
dedicated to the same Saint as the former,
from which it is distinguished by
the epithet <i>the West</i>. It appears to have
been built four or five hundred years,
since there are accounts of funerals and
donations to it from the year 1421, with
earlier anecdotes of little consequence;
and it is easy to see that it has been repaired
and altered at different periods,
till the original style, whatever it was, is
lost. It narrowly escaped the fire in
1666, the flames stopping within three
houses of it. This edifice, in a very
disagreeable manner, stands out into the
street, and as it has been observed, is but
an incumbrance to the way, and without
having any thing but deformity itself,
spoils the beauty of the whole street,
and hides the prospect of Temple Bar,
which would terminate the view very
advantageously, and be seen almost as far
again as it is at present. The church
consists of a large body, and a small
tower, every way unproportioned. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>shops, which are in a kind of sheds below
it, make, as it were, a part of the
building. The clock projects to the
south near the west end, and for the
amusement of the gaping vulgar, two
human figures are placed in a kind of
Ionic loggia, and by means of clock
work, strike two bells hung over them,
and declare the hour and quarters. <i>English

<p class='c030'>This church was originally a rectory
in the patronage of the convent of Westminster;

vicarage, and being granted by King Edward

since continued in lay hands. The Vicar
receives 240<i>l.</i> a year in lieu of tithes.

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>East India Company</span>, was first incorporated
by a charter granted by Queen
Elizabeth in 1601, when the first subscription
for carrying on this trade
amounted to 739,782<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> and a year
or two after by an additional subscription
of 834,826<i>l.</i> the stock was raised to
1,574,608<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> and with this capital
they established a commerce by the Red
sea to Arabia, and to Persia, India, China,
and several of the East India islands.
But about the beginning of the protectorate
of Oliver Cromwell, it being imagined
that the laying open the trade to
the East Indies would be of advantage
to the whole nation, that commerce was
made general, and thus continued till the
year 1657, when it being found that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>separate trade was of disadvantage to the
undertakers, they were for the good of
the whole united to the company by the
legislature. <i>Stow’s Survey, last edit.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>However in the year 1698, a new
East India company was established, by
virtue of which the old company was to
be dissolved after the expiration of a certain
term allowed them for the disposing
of their effects. This new company
immediately advanced two millions sterling
to the government, at eight <i>per cent.</i>
However, by the kind offices of friends,
the two companies were united in the
year 1702, when a new charter was
granted them under the title of <i>The united
Company of Merchants trading to the
East Indies</i>, and the old company had
their share of the two millions. In the
6th of Queen Anne, the united company
lent the government 1,200,000<i>l.</i> which
made their whole loan to amount to
3,200,000<i>l.</i> the interest of part of which
was a few years ago reduced to 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
<i>per cent.</i> and part to 3<i>l.</i> <i>per cent.</i> the first
of these is now called the 3 1-half <i>per
cent.</i> annuities, and the last the 3 <i>per
cent.</i> annuities.</p>

<p class='c030'>As to India stock, it is the trading
stock of the company, and the proprietors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>instead of receiving regular annuities
for money at interest, have dividends
of the profits arising from the company’s
trade, which being more valuable,
these shares generally sell much above
the original value. <i>Pocket Library.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>The transfer days of India stock, are
now Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday;
and of India annuities on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, except on Holidays,
which are the same as at the
Bank. See <span class='sc'>Bank</span> <i>of England</i>.</p>

<p class='c030'>The hour of payment of dividends is
from nine o’clock to eleven, and from
twelve o’clock to three; and the hour
of transfer from twelve to one.</p>

<p class='c030'>As to the management of this company,
500<i>l.</i> in the company’s stock gives
the owner a vote in the general courts,
and 2000<i>l.</i> qualifies a person to be chosen
a Director. The Directors are twenty-four
in number, including the Chairman
and Deputy Chairman, who may be reelected
four years successively. The Chairman
has a salary of 200<i>l.</i> a year, and each
of the Directors 150<i>l.</i> A court of the
Directors is held at least once a week,
at the East India House; but they are
commonly held oftener, they being summoned
as occasions require.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Out of the body of Directors are chosen
several committees, who have the peculiar
inspection of separate branches of
the company’s business; as the committee
of buying, committee of correspondence,
committee of accounts, committee of the
treasury, a house committee, a warehouse
committee, a committee of shipping,
a committee to prevent the growth
of private trade, and a committee of
law suits.</p>

<p class='c030'>The East India company export bullion
to a very great value, with woollen
cloth, lead, and some other English commodities;
and import China ware, tea,
cabinets, raw and wrought silks, calicoes,
chints, pepper, &amp;c. but all the
wrought silks, and calicoes, are to be
exported again.</p>

<p class='c030'>All the goods imported by the company
are to be sold openly by inch of
candle, on pain of forfeiting one half to
the King, and the other to the prosecutor.</p>

<p class='c030'>East India stock is esteemed in law,
personal estate, and the shares exempt
from taxes.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>East India House</span>, on the south side of
Leadenhall street, and a little to the west
of Lime street. This edifice was built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>on the place where anciently stood the
city house of the Lord Craven, and his
ancestors. The present structure was
erected by the company in the year 1726.
It is a plain Doric on a rustic basement,
and has not much to be found
fault with or commended. It might
have been justly considered as a very fine
edifice, had it been the house of a single
Director; but it is not at all equal to the
grandeur of this company, and the great
figure they make in the trading world;
nor bears any proportion to the idea we
conceive of this body, when we consider,
that the Directors who meet here, appoint
or remove Governors who are their
servants, and yet have all the dignity and
state of Kings, some of whom seldom
stir abroad without their guards and a
numerous retinue, or eat, but upon gilt
plate, or the finest China.</p>

<p class='c030'>The house, however, though too
small in front, extends far backwards,
and is very spacious, having large rooms
for the use of the Directors, and offices
for the clerks. It has a spacious hall
and court yard for the reception of those
who have business, and who attend on
the company on court days, which are
every Wednesday. There also belongs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>to it a garden, with warehouses in the
back part toward Lime street, to which
there is a back gate for the entrance of
carts to bring in goods. These warehouses
were rebuilt in a very handsome
manner in the year 1725, and are now
greatly enlarged. The company have
likewise warehouses in Seething lane,
the Steel yard, and at the Royal Exchange,
particularly under the last they
have spacious cellars entirely for pepper.

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Eastland Company.</span> These merchants
were first incorporated by a charter
granted them by Queen Elizabeth in the
year 1579, and their factory being first
settled at Elbing in Prussia, they obtained
the name of the merchants of Elbing.
By their charter they were impowered to
trade to Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Poland, Prussia, and all the other parts
of the Baltic, exclusive of the city
of Narva, which had been previously
granted to the Russia company; but the
smallness of the river Elbing rendering
it very incommodious for navigation, the
factory removed, and settled at Dantzick,
Koningsberg, Riga, and other cities of
the Baltic.</p>

<p class='c030'>This company was confirmed by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>charter granted by King Charles II. but
by a late act of parliament any persons
are allowed to trade to Norway and
Sweden, though not of this company:
and the Eastland commerce in general
is in a manner laid open.</p>

<p class='c030'>Our commodities exported to these
countries, are woollen cloths, serges, kersies,
Norwich stuffs, perpetuanoes, cottons,
stockings, hats, tin, pewter, lead,
&amp;c. and in return they import to England
timber, deals, masts, oars, clap
boards, balks, bomspars, cantspars, pipe-staves,
flax, pitch, tar, tallow, pot-ashes,
wheat, rye, rich furrs, bees wax, and
several other commodities. This trade
is however generally allowed to be of
great disadvantage to England, as the
balance against us annually amounts to
several hundred thousand pounds: which
is the more extraordinary, as all these articles
might be had from our own American
plantations.</p>

<p class='c030'>For the management of the affairs of
this company, they have a Governor,
Deputy Governor, and court of Assistants,
consisting of twenty-four of the
members, annually chosen on the first
Wednesday after Michaelmas day, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>they have their meetings monthly; or as

<p class='c030'>The late Duke of Chandos built near
this town one of the most noble seats in
England, which he adorned and furnished
at such vast expence, that it had
scarce its equal in the kingdom. The
great saloon or hall was painted by Paolucci,
and the plaistering and gilding of
the house was done by the famous Italian
Pergotti. The columns supporting
the building were all of marble: the
grand stair-case was extremely fine; the
steps were marble, and every step was
one whole piece twenty-two feet in
length.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The avenue was spacious and majestic,
and as it afforded the view of two
fronts, joined as it were in one, the distance
not permitting you to see the angle
that was in the center, so you were
agreeably deceived into the opinion, that
the front of the house was twice as large
as it really was. And yet on approaching
nearer, you were again surprized, by perceiving
a winding passage opening, as it
were, a new front to the eye of near an
hundred and twenty feet wide, which
you imagined not to have seen before.</p>

<p class='c030'>The gardens were well designed, and
the canals large and noble. The chapel
was a singularity both in its building and
the beauty of the workmanship, and the
late Duke maintained there at one time
a full choir, and had divine worship performed
with the best music, after the
manner of the chapel royal. But all this
grandeur was soon at an end. The furniture
and curiosities were brought to
public auction; and this superb edifice
quite demolished. <i>Tour through Great

<p class='c030'>The first sacred edifice in this place,

on an eminence, within a mile of
Stanmore, and in the road from Watford
to High Barnet. It is also called
Eaglestree, Illstree, and Idlestree.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Eltham</span>, a town in Kent, seven miles
from London in the road to Maidstone.
Here a palace was built by Anthony
Beck, Bishop of Durham, who bestowed
it upon Queen Eleanor, the wife of
Edward I. King Edward II. constantly
resided in this place, and his son being
born here, was on that account called
John of Eltham. The palace here was
afterwards much enlarged by the succeeding
Kings, who when the court was
kept at Greenwich often retired hither;
and here were made the statutes of Eltham
by which the King’s house is still
governed. There are however no traces
of the palace left. The town has the
honour of giving the title of Earl to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Prince of Wales; and there are here the
houses of several rich citizens, and two
charity schools.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Ely</span> <i>court</i>, Holborn; so called from the
Bishop of Ely’s house, which is not far
from it.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Ely House</span>, the city mansion of the Bishop
of Ely, was formerly called Ely’s
Inn. It is situated in Holborn, and
stands on a large piece of ground. Before
it is a spacious court, and behind it
a garden of considerable extent; but it
is so ill kept that it scarcely deserves the
name. The buildings are very old;
and consist of a large hall, several spacious
rooms, and a good chapel.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Emanuel</span> <i>Hospital</i>, at Tothill side in
Westminster, was founded by the Lady
Dacres, in the year 1601, for twenty
old bachelors and maids, sixteen of
whom to be of St. Margaret’s parish
Westminster, two of Hayes, and two of
Chelsea parishes; each of whom have
an allowance of 10<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, with
the liberty of bringing up a poor child.
According to certain constitutions formed
by the foundress’s executors, no person
of ill fame, or that cannot say the creed
and ten commandments in English; or
are under fifty years of age; or have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>lived three years in the said parishes, are
to be admitted upon this foundation.</p>

<p class='c030'>The city of London is intrusted with
the management of this charity, and is
to receive annually 200<i>l.</i> for its support,
out of an estate in Yorkshire, till the expiration
of a lease of 199 years, when
the produce of the whole manor, which
is said to amount to above 600<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, is to be appropriated to the augmentation
of this foundation.</p>

<p class='c030'>Some time ago the Court of Lord Mayor
and Aldermen caused to be erected at
the upper end of this hospital, a handsome
school house and dormitory, for
the reception of twenty poor boys and
girls, who were first admitted in the
year 1735. They are supplied with the
necessaries of life; the boys are taught
reading, writing, and accounts; and the
girls reading, writing, and plain work.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Enfield</span>, a town in Middlesex near eleven
miles from London. Almost in the
center of Enfield Chace, are the ruins
of an old house, said to have belonged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the Earls of Essex. Here is a fine lodge
for the ranger, and the skirts of the
chace abound with handsome country
houses belonging to the citizens of London.
When King James I. resided at
Theobalds, this chace was well stocked
with deer, and all sorts of game; but
in the civil wars it was stripped both of
the game and timber, and even let out in
farms: however, after the restoration it
was again laid open, woods were planted,
and the whole chace afresh stocked
with deer.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Epping</span>, a town in Essex, seventeen miles
from London. The markets, which are
on Thursday for cattle, and on Friday
for provisions, are kept in Epping street,
a hamlet about a mile and a half from
the church. There are several fine seats
in Epping Forest, which is a royal
chace, and extends from the town almost
to London.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Epsom</span>, a well-built and handsome town
in Surry, sixteen miles from London, abounds
with very genteel houses, which
are principally the retreats of the merchants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>and citizens of London, and is a
delightful place open to Bansted Downs.
Its mineral waters, which issue from a
rising ground nearer Ashted than Epsom,
were discovered in 1618, and soon became
extremely famous; but though
they are not impaired in virtue, they are
far from being in the same repute as formerly;
however, the salt made of them
is valued all over Europe. The hall,
galleries, and other public apartments,
are now run to decay, and there remains
only one house on the spot, which is inhabited
by a countryman and his wife,
who carry the waters in bottles to the
adjacent places. Horse races are annually
held on the neighbouring downs.
The town extends about a mile and a
half in a semicircle from the church to
Lord Guilford’s fine seat at Durdans; and,
as Mr. Whatley observes, there are here
so many fields, meadows, orchards and
gardens, that a stranger would be at a
loss to know whether this was a town
in a wood, or a wood in a town. There
are many fine seats in this neighbourhood,
besides Durdans, already mentioned,
as Lord Baltimore’s, the Lady
Fielding’s, Earl of Berkshire’s, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Esher</span>, a village in Surry, situated near
Walton upon Thames and Hampton
Court, of which last it affords a fine
prospect, as well as of the other parts of
Middlesex.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Esher Place</span>, was the seat of the late
Henry Pelham, Esq; The house is a
Gothic structure built of a brownish red
brick, with stone facings to the doors,
windows, &amp;c. It stands upon almost
the lowest ground belonging to it, and
has the river Mole gliding close by it
and through the grounds. This house
was originally one of those built by Cardinal
Wolsey; but the late Mr. Pelham
rebuilt the whole, except the two towers
in the body of the house, which are
the same that belonged to the old building,
and the whole is rebuilt in the same
style of architecture it was before, which
uniformity is certainly better than an
unnatural mixture of Gothic and modern
too often practised. There is a fine
summer house built upon a hill on the
left hand as you enter, which commands
the view of the house, park, and country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>round on both sides the Thames for many
miles. The park or ground in which
the house is situated appears quite plain
and unadorned; yet perhaps not a little
art has been used to give it this natural
and simple appearance, which is certainly
very pleasing. But in one part of it
there is a pretty wilderness laid out in
walks, and planted with a variety of
ever-green trees and plants, with a
grotto in it, and seats in different places.
The wood in the park is well disposed,
and consists of fine oak, elm, and other
trees, and the whole country round appears
finely shaded with wood.</p>

<p class='c030'>The grand floor of the house is elegantly
finished, and consists of six rooms.
The great parlour is carved and gilt in
a taste suitable to the style of the house,
with curious marble chimney pieces and
slab. In this room are the portraits of
Mr. Pelham, Sir Robert Walpole, afterwards
Earl of Orford, Lord Townshend,
Duke of Rutland, the late Duke of Devonshire,
and the late Duke of Grafton;
a picture of Lady Catharine Pelham and
her son is over the chimney. In the
drawing room over the chimney there is
a picture of King Charles II. when only
eleven years old, by Vandyke. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>library is curiously finished, and there
is a good collection of books in it. Some
say it was at this house Cardinal Wolsey
was first seized by order of Henry VIII.
on his refusing to annul his marriage
with Queen Catharine, that he might
marry Ann Boleyn, and which refusal
brought on his fall.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Eton College</span>, justly celebrated for the
many learned men it has produced, is
situated in Buckinghamshire on the
banks of the Thames opposite to Windsor,
and was founded by Henry VI.
for the support of a Provost and seven
Fellows, one of whom is Vice-Provost,
and for the education of seventy King’s
scholars, as those are called, who are
on the foundation. These when properly
qualified, are elected, on the
first Tuesday in August, to King’s College,
Cambridge, but they are not removed,
till there are vacancies in the
college, and then they are called according
to seniority; and after they have
been three years at Cambridge, they claim
a fellowship. Besides those on the foundation,
there are seldom less than three
hundred scholars, at this time there are
many more, who board at the masters
houses, or within the bounds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>college. The school is divided into
upper and lower, and each of these into
three classes. To each school there
is a master and four assistants or ushers.
The revenue of the college is about
5000<i>l.</i> a year. Here is a noble library
enriched by a fine collection of books
left by Dr. Waddington, Bishop of
Chester, valued at 2000<i>l.</i> and Lord
Chief Justice Reeves presented to this
library the collection left him by Richard
Topham, Esq; keeper of the records
in the Tower. In the great court
is a fine statue of the founder, erected
at the expence of the late Provost Dr.
Godolphin, Dean of St. Paul’s. The
chapel is in a good style of Gothic architecture.
The schools and other parts,
which are in the other style of building,
are equally well, and seem like the
design of Inigo Jones.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>, one of the four great courts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of the kingdom, is held in a room contiguous
to the north west corner of
Westminster hall, and is so named from
a chequered cloth, which anciently
covered the table where the Judges,
or chief officers sat. This court was
first erected by William the Conqueror,
for the trial of all causes relating to
the revenues of the crown; and in the
same court there are now also tried matters
of equity between subject and subject.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Judges of this court are, the
Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer,
and three other Judges called Barons
of the Exchequer; who are all created
by letters patent to hold their offices
<i>quamdiu se bene gesserint</i>. There is also
the Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer,
who administers the oath to the Sheriffs,
Under-Sheriffs, bailiffs, searchers, surveyors,
&amp;c. of the Custom house; but
is no Judge. When at any time the
Barons are of different opinions concerning
the decision of any cause, they call
to their assistance the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who decides in favour of one
of the parties by his casting vote. <i>Dugdale’s
Orig. Jurid.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>Long after the conquest there sat in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the Exchequer both spiritual and temporal
Barons, whence in later times
those who sat there, tho’ they were
not Peers, were stiled Barons.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>, or <i>the Office of the receipt of
his Majesty’s</i> <span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>, a plain old
building formed of wood and plaister,
at the south end of New Palace yard,
where the King’s revenue is received
and disbursed. This important office is
under the direction of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, who has the custody
of the Exchequer seal; he has also the
comptrollment of the rolls of the Lords
of the Treasury, and sits in the court
above the Barons of the Exchequer. He
has the gift of the office of Comptroller
of the Pipe, and of that of Clerk of
the Nihils.</p>

<p class='c030'>The Auditor of the receipts of the
Exchequer, is another great officer.
He files the bills of the Tellers, and draws
all orders to be signed by the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, for
issuing forth all money, in virtue of
privy seals, which are recorded by the
Clerk of the Pells, and entered and lodged
in the Auditor’s office. He also, by
warrant from the Lords of the Treasury,
makes debentures to the several persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>who have fees, annuities or pensions,
by letters patent from the King, out
of the Exchequer, and directs them
for payment to the Tellers. He daily
receives the state of each Teller’s account,
and weekly certifies the whole
to the Lords Commissioners, who immediately
present the estimate, or balance
to the King. He makes half
yearly, at Michaelmas and Lady-day,
a book called <i>A Declaration</i>, containing a
methodical abstract of all the accounts
and payments made the preceding half
year, and delivers one of them to the
Lords of the Treasury, and another to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and
by him are kept the registers appointed
for paying all persons in course, upon
several branches of the King’s revenue.
For the discharge of these offices, he has
a chief clerk, a clerk of the debentures,
a clerk of the registers and issues, a
clerk of the cash book, and a clerk for
making out Exchequer bills; and in the
offices for annuities under the Auditor
are two chief clerks, and nine clerks
under them.</p>

<p class='c030'>The other great officers are the four
Tellers of the Exchequer, each of whom
has his deputy, his first clerk, and four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>other clerks. Their office is to receive
all moneys due to the King, and thereupon
to throw down a bill through a
pipe into the tally court, where it is received
by the Auditor’s clerk, who there
attends to write the words of the bill upon
a tally, and then delivers the same
to be entered by the Clerk of the Pells, or
his under clerk, who attends to enter it
in his book; then the tally is cloven
by the two Deputy Chamberlains, and
while the senior deputy reads one part,
the junior examines the other part with
the two clerks.</p>

<p class='c030'>Another great officer is the Clerk of
the Pells, who enters the Tellers bills
on a parchment skin, in latin <i>Pellis</i>, and
likewise all receipts and payment for the
King; this officer is in the nature of
a comptroller; he has a deputy, a clerk
for the <i>introitus</i>, and another for the
<i>exitus</i>. There are also a clerk of the declarations,
and a clerk of the patents.
In this office there are likewise three
vouchers of the Tellers.</p>
<p class='c025'><i>Tally Court in the</i> <span class='sc'>Exchequer</span>. In order
to give a more perfect idea of this office,
it will be proper to say something of
the nature of tallies. The word tally
is derived from the French word <i>tailler</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>to cut, a tally being a piece of wood
wrote upon on both sides, containing
an acquittance for money received,
which being cloven asunder by the Deputy
Chamberlains, one part, called the
stock, is delivered to the person who
pays or lends any money to the government;
and the other part, called the
counter-stock or counter-foil, remains in
the office, to be kept till called for, and
joined with the stock. This method
of striking tallies is very ancient, and
has been found by long experience to
be the best way of preventing frauds
that ever was invented; for it is morrally
impossible so to counterfeit a tally,
but upon rejoining it with the counter-foil,
the intended fraud will be obvious
to every eye, either in the notches
or the cleaving, in the length or in the
breadth, in the natural growth, or in the
shape of the counter-foil.</p>

<p class='c030'>To the tally court belong the two
Chamberlains of the Exchequer, in
whose custody are many ancient records,
leagues, and treaties with foreign princes,
the standards of money, weights, and
measures, those ancient books called the
Black Book of the Exchequer, and
Doomsday Book, which last contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>an account of all the cities, towns, villages
and families in the reign of William
the Conqueror. This book is kept
under three locks and keys, and cannot
be examined for less than 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d</i>.
and for every line transcribed is paid 4<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class='c030'>Under these officers are four Deputy
Chamberlains, in whose office are preserved
all the counter-foils of the above
tallies, so exactly ranked by months
or years, that they may be easily found
out, in order to be joined with their
respective tallies, which being done and
proved true, they deliver it attested for
a lawful tally to the Clerk of the Pipe,
to be allowed in the great roll.</p>

<p class='c030'>The other officers of this court, are
the Usher of the Exchequer, his deputy
and clerk; three Paymasters of Exchequer
bills, their deputy, and a Comptroller
of Exchequer bills; a tally writer
for the Auditor, who has two assistant
clerks, and a tally cutter. <i>Chamberlain’s

<p class='c030'>There are several other offices belonging
to the Exchequer, as the pipe office

under their care, have occasioned their
number to be increased to nine. These
receive the produce of the excise of beer,
ale, and other liquors, of coffee, tea,
and chocolate, of malt, hops, soap, starch,
candles, paper, calicoes, gold and silver
wire, vellum, parchment, hides and
skins, collected all over England, and
pay it into the Exchequer. They have
each a salary of 1000<i>l.</i> a year, and are
obliged by oath to take no fee or reward,
but from the King only.</p>

<p class='c030'>Before the Commissioners of Excise are
tried all frauds committed in the several
branches of the revenue under their direction;

appeal to the Commissioners of Appeal

<p class='c030'>At the desire of the Commissioners of
this office, a very laudable practice is
lately set on foot, for the support of the

It owes its name to its being dedicated to
St. Faith, or <i>Sancta Fides</i>, a French
virgin of the city of Agen, in the province
of Aquitain, who is said to have
suffered martyrdom in the reign of the
Emperor Dioclesian, for refusing to sacrifice
to idols. No records however

St. Paul’s cathedral, it was thought proper
entirely to demolish it, and to unite

iron rails, to afford a view of this statue,
the more modern hospital, erected by
that gentleman, and the pleasant walks

<p class='c030'>The Fishmongers company erected
St. Peter’s hospital by virtue of letters
patent granted by King James I. in the
year 1618, for the reception of several
of their poor members who had pensions
bequeathed them by the wills of
several members of the company: thirteen
of whom were beadsmen and
women of the company’s great benefactor
Sir Thomas Knesworth, who in
1513 left them 8<i>d</i>. <i>per</i> week each.
Sir Thomas Hunt also in 1615 left
20<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> <i>per annum</i> towards the support
of six ancient poor men and women.
Richard Edmunds in 1620 bequeathed
an annual sum of 6<i>l.</i> towards
the maintenance of two poor persons;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>which number of twenty-one pensioners,
with one added by the company, were
put into this hospital; and soon after
Sir John Leman, Sir John Gayer, Mr.
Harper, Arthur Mouse and Mrs. Anne
Bromsgrove, by their respective wills
demised several sums to the amount of
28<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c030'>Each of the twenty-two almspeople
have two rooms, and an allowance of 3<i>s.</i>

one of the pensioners, who reads prayers
twice a day in the chapel has an additional
allowance of 2<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c030'>The more modern structure was, as
we have already said, founded by Mr.
James Hulbert, citizen and fishmonger,
for the accommodation of twenty
poor men and women; who besides
two neat rooms to live in, have each
an allowance of 3<i>s.</i> a week, one chaldron

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Fleet Bridge</span>, at the end of Fleet Ditch
next the market. Since the filling up
of Fleet Ditch, this can scarcely be termed
a bridge; but as one of the walls of
the bridge is still left, for the security of
passengers, by preventing their falling
into the ditch on that side, it still retains
its ancient name.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Fleet Ditch</span>, a part of the town ditch
by which Turnmill brook, and the little
river Fleet, fell into the Thames. In
this ditch flood gates were erected in the
year 1606; and after the fire of London,
it was by order of the Mayor and court
of Aldermen, cleansed, enlarged, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>made navigable, for barges to come up
by the benefit of the tides, as far as
Holborn Bridge, where Turnmill brook
fell into this channel. The sides were
built of stone and brick, with warehouses
on each side, which ran under
the street, and were designed to be used
for laying in of coals, and other commodities.
It had five feet water at the
lowest tide at Holborn Bridge: the wharfs
on each side of the channel were thirty-five
feet broad; and were rendered secure
from danger in the night by rails
of oak being placed along the sides of
the ditch. Over this canal were four
bridges of Portland stone, viz. at Bridewell,
Fleet street, Fleet lane, and Holborn.
The whole expence of sinking,
clearing, wharfing, planking and piling,
with that of paving, posting and railing,
amounted in the whole to 27,777<i>l.</i> besides
what was paid to the several proprietors,
whose grounds were taken for the
enlargement of the wharfs and keys, on
either side of the channel. <i>Camden.</i> <i>Stow.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>In digging this canal between Fleet
prison and Holborn Bridge, several Roman
utensils were discovered at the depth
of fifteen feet; and, a little deeper, a
great quantity of Roman coins in silver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>copper, brass, and all other metals except
gold. Those of silver were ring-money
of several sizes, the largest about
the bigness of a crown, but gradually
decreasing; the smallest were about the
size of a silver two-pence, each having a
snip in the edge: and at Holborn Bridge
were dug up two brazen Lares, or Houshold
gods, about four inches in length,
which were almost incrusted with a petrific
matter: one of these was Bacchus,
and the other Ceres: but the coins lying
at the bottom of the current, their lustre
was in a great measure preserved by the
water incessantly washing off the corroding
salt.</p>

<p class='c030'>Probably the great quantity of coin
found in this ditch, was thrown in by
the Roman inhabitants of this city, for
its preservation, at the approach of Boadicea,
at the head of her army; but
all the Roman citizens, without distinction
of age or sex, being barbarously massacred
by the justly enraged Britons, it
was not discovered till this time. Besides
the above mentioned antiquities,
several things of a more modern date
were discovered, as arrow heads, scales,
seals, with the proprietors names upon
them in Saxon characters; spur-rowels of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>an hand’s breadth, keys and daggers coated
over with a livid petrific rust; together
with a considerable number of medals,
with crosses, crucifixes, and Ave Maries
engraven thereupon. <i>Conyer’s MSS. in
Sir Hans Sloane’s library in the Museum.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>Fleet Ditch now extends no higher
than Fleet Bridge, all above being arched,
covered over, and converted into a
market; and the building the fine bridge
at Black Friars, will soon occasion all
that is left of this ditch to be filled up.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Fleet</span> <i>lane</i>, Old Bailey, extends to Fleet
market.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Fleet Market</span>, situated upon the canal
called Fleet Ditch, was opened on the
30th of September 1737. Instead of
stalls there are two rows of shops of a
great length from north to south, with
a handsome walk between, into which
light is thrown by windows placed along
the top; and in the center is a neat
lanthorn with a clock; the whole of this
part is paved with rag stones. On the
south end, the fruiterers stands are made
in the form of piazzas erected on each
side, and these have proper conveniences
to deposit their remaining stock.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Fleet Prison</span>, is situated on the east side
of Fleet market, and a little to the south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>of Fleet lane, and was originally so
called from the river Fleet running by
it. It is very large, and reckoned the
best prison in the city for good rooms,
and other conveniences. It has the benefit
of an open yard, which is enclosed
with a very high wall.</p>

<p class='c030'>The keeper is called the Warden of
the Fleet; and besides his fees from the
prisoners for turning the key, for chamber
rent, &amp;c. which amount to a considerable
sum, he has the rents of the
shops in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p class='c030'>This prison belongs to the court of
Common Pleas, and hither persons are
committed for contempt of orders, &amp;c.
in the high court of Chancery; or upon
debt, when by a writ of Habeas Corpus
they remove themselves thither from any
other prison.</p>

<p class='c030'>The <i>rules</i> or <i>liberties</i> of the <i>Fleet</i>, are
all the north side of Ludgate hill, and
the Old Bailey up to Fleet lane; down
that lane into the market, and then

east side along by the Fleet prison to the
bottom of Ludgate hill.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Foots Cray Place</span>, in Kent, about
twelve miles from London, is the seat
of Bouchier Cleeve, Esq; and was built
by himself, after a design of Palladio,
of the Ionic order, and is very elegant.
The original design had four porticoes,
three of which are filled up to get
more room. The hall is octagonal, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>has a gallery round which conveys you
to the bed chambers. It is enlightened
from the top, and is very beautiful. The
edifice is built of stone, but the offices,
which are on each side at some distance,
are brick. The house stands on a rising
ground, with a gradual descent from it
till you come to the water, which from
the house appears to be a small river
gliding along through the whole length
of the ground: and in that part of the
water which is opposite to the house,
there is a fine cascade constantly flowing
out of it. But this water which appears
to be such a pretty natural stream, is in
reality artificial, and is brought from the
river Cray which runs just by. When
the canal or cut which is made through
the ground to receive the water from
the river is full, it forms the cascade before
the house, by flowing over in that place,
and the surplus water being instantly
buried in the ground, is again conveyed
away under this cut or canal to
the main stream. The chief beauty of
the ground about the house consists in
its simplicity, it being entirely without
ornament, and the whole of it a kind
of lawn, having little besides the plain
turf. The situation is pleasant, and the
prospect from the house very good.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>The disposition of the rooms within
the house appear to be very convenient,
and the several apartments are elegantly
finished and suitably furnished.
The Chinese bed and other furniture of
this kind in the principal bed chamber,
is perfectly beautiful. The gallery,
which extends the whole length of the
north front of the house, is a very grand
room, and is filled with pictures by the
most eminent masters; and there are
several other good pieces of this kind in
the dining room and parlour, of all
which the following is an exact list.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Foundling</span> <i>Hospital</i>, or more properly
<i>The Hospital for exposed and deserted
Children</i>, in Lamb’s Conduit fields. This
is one of the most useful among the numerous
charities that are an honour to
this age and nation. In the reign of her
late majesty Queen Anne, several eminent
merchants, filled with compassion
for the many innocent children who
were daily exposed to misery and destruction,
proposed to erect an hospital
for the reception of such infants, as either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>the misfortunes or inhumanity of their
parents should leave destitute of other
support; and to employ them in such a
manner as to render them fit for the most
laborious offices, and the lowest stations.
With these laudable views they proposed
a subscription, and sollicited a charter;
but they sollicited in vain, from the ill-grounded
prejudices of weak people, who
conceived the opinion that such an undertaking
would encourage persons in
vice, by making too easy a provision for
their illegitimate children.</p>

<p class='c030'>However, though this suspended, it did
not totally defeat this laudable design;
some of these worthy persons left large
benefactions for the use of such an hospital
as soon as it should be erected;
which coming to the ears of the humane
and generous Mr. Thomas Coram,
a commander of a ship in the merchants
service, he left the sea to sollicit
a charter for the establishment of this
charity, and with unwearied assiduity
spent all the remainder of his life in
promoting this great design; from no
other motive than his zeal for the public,
and his compassion for the helpless
innocents who were frequently dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>in the streets, or murdered to conceal
the shame of their parents.</p>

<p class='c030'>Before he presented any petition to his
Majesty, he was advised to procure a recommendation
of his design from some
persons of quality and distinction. This
he sollicited with unwearied diligence,
by which means he procured the following
memorial to be signed by the Ladies
whose names are under-written.</p>

<p class='c033'>“Whereas among the many excellent
designs and institutions of charity
which this nation, and especially the
city of London, has hitherto encouraged
and established, no expedient
has yet been found out for preventing
the frequent murders of poor miserable
infants at their birth; or for suppressing
the inhuman custom of exposing
new-born infants to perish in the
streets; or the putting out such unhappy
foundlings to wicked and barbarous
nurses, who, undertaking to
bring them up for a small and trifling
sum of money, do often suffer them
to starve for want of due sustenance
or care; or, if permitted to live, either
turn them into the streets to beg or
steal, or hire them out to loose persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>by whom they are trained up in
that infamous way of living, and
sometimes are blinded, or maimed
and distorted in their limbs, in order
to move pity and compassion, and
thereby become fitter instruments of
gain to those vile merciless wretches.</p>

<p class='c034'>“For a beginning to redress so deplorable
a grievance, and to prevent
as well the effusion of so much innocent
blood, as the fatal consequences
of that idleness, beggary, or stealing,
in which such poor foundlings are
generally bred up; and to enable
them, by an early and effectual care
of their education, to become useful
members of the commonwealth: We,
whose names are underwritten, being
deeply touched with compassion for
the sufferings and lamentable condition
of such poor abandoned helpless
infants, as well as the enormous abuses
and mischiefs to which they are exposed;
and in order to supply the government
plentifully with useful hands
on many occasions; and for the better
producing good and faithful servants
from amongst the poor and miserable
cast-off children, or foundlings,
now a pest to the public, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>chargeable nuisance within the bills of
mortality; and for settling a yearly
income for their maintenance and proper
education, till they come to a fit
age for service; are desirous to encourage,
and willing to contribute towards
erecting an hospital for infants
whom their parents are not able to
maintain, and have no right to any
parish; which we conceive will not
only prevent many horrid murders,
cruelties, and other mischiefs, and be
greatly beneficial to the public; but
will also be acceptable to God Almighty,
as being the only remedy of
such great evils, which have been so
long neglected, though always complained
of; provided due and proper
care be taken for setting on foot so
necessary an establishment, and a royal
charter be granted by the King to
such persons as his Majesty shall approve
of, who shall be willing to become
benefactors for the erecting and
endowing such an hospital; and for
the receiving the voluntary contributions
of charitable and well-disposed
persons; and for directing and managing
the affairs thereof <i>gratis</i>, to
the best advantage, under such regulations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>as his Majesty, in his great
wisdom, shall judge most proper for
attaining the desired effect of our
good intentions.”</p>

<p class='c036'>Mr. Coram having, to the everlasting
honour of the above Ladies, obtained so
many names to this recommendation, procured
another to the same purpose, signed
by a great number of noblemen and gentlemen,
and annexed both these to his
petition to the King. Upon this his Majesty
was graciously pleased to grant his
royal charter for establishing this hospital,
which was dated the 17th of October,
1739.</p>

<p class='c030'>In pursuance of this patent, the Duke
of Bedford, who was appointed the first
President, summoned the several members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>of the society to meet him at Somerset
House on the 20th of Nov. when
most of the noblemen and gentlemen mentioned
in the charter being assembled,
Thomas Coram, Esq; thanked his Grace,
and the rest of the noblemen and gentlemen,
for their protection and assistance
in promoting the patent. A committee
of fifteen noblemen and gentlemen were
chosen to manage the estate and effects
of the hospital; and it was ordered, that
accounts of several hospitals of this nature
in other countries should be obtained
as soon as possible; for which purpose
application was made to his Majesty’s
Ambassadors and Ministers abroad, and
the Governors soon after received authentic
accounts of the institutions and
regulations of the hospitals of Amsterdam,
Paris, and Lisbon, for the reception
of infants; and have since also been
favoured with that of Venice; and, tho’
these institutions were all accommodated
to the laws and governments of their
respective countries, and were therefore
unfit or impracticable to be wholly executed
in this kingdom, yet they afforded
useful instructions towards forming a plan
for the government of this hospital. Books
were now opened, and the Governors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>obtained large subscriptions; the work
went on with great spirit; an act of
parliament was obtained to confirm and
enlarge the powers granted by his Majesty
to the Governors and Guardians of
the hospital. A piece of ground was
purchased in Lamb’s Conduit fields, of
the Earl of Salisbury, which his Lordship
not only sold at a very reasonable
price, but promoted the charity by a
noble benefaction.</p>

<p class='c030'>As the building an hospital would
necessarily take up much time, and the
Governors were extremely desirous of
beginning to take in children, they hired
a large house in Hatton Garden, nurses
were provided, and it was resolved that
sixty children should be admitted. As
the funds increased, more and more
were received; and it was soon thought
impracticable to provide a sufficient
number of healthy wet nurses, therefore
the children were intrusted to the care
of dry nurses: but the ill consequences
of this regulation soon appeared; much
fewer dying in proportion to their number,
among those that sucked, than among
those that were weaned; and it
was also found by experience, that of
the young children sent into the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>fewer dyed in proportion to their
numbers, than those who remained in
the hospital. These observations determined
the committee to come to a resolution
to send all the children that
should be taken in, as soon as possible into
the country, and to allow them to remain
there till three years old; and that all such
as would suck, should have wet nurses
only. Some time after the children were
ordered to be inoculated, which was attended
with great success.</p>

<p class='c030'>In 1745, one wing of the hospital
being finished, the committee ordered the
children to be removed thither, and
quitted the house in Hatton Garden.
A chapel being now much wanted, and
several Ladies of quality being desirous
of contributing to it, a subscription was
opened for that purpose, the first stone
was laid on the first of May 1747, and a
neat and elegant edifice was soon erected.</p>

</div>

<p class='c030'>On the 29th of March 1749, the
Governors at a general court being informed
of the increase of benefactions
to this charity, of the number of the
children, and the expediency of keeping
the boys separate from the girls,
gave directions for building the other
wing of the hospital, and the whole design
has been since compleated. These wings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>are directly opposite to each other, and
are built in a plain but regular, substantial,
and convenient manner, of brick,
with handsome piazzas. It is well suited
to the purpose, and as fine as hospitals
should be. On the farthest end is placed
the chapel, which is joined to the
wings by an arch on each side, and is
very elegant within. Before the hospital
is a large piece of ground, on each
side whereof is a colonade of great
length, which also extends towards the
gates, that are double, with a massy
pier between, so that coaches may
pass and repass at the same time; and
on each side is a door to admit those
on foot. The large area between this
outer gate and the hospital is adorned
with grass plats, gravel walks, and lamps
erected upon handsome posts: besides
which there are two handsome gardens.
The print shews the hospital in two
different views.</p>

<p class='c030'>In erecting these buildings particular
care was taken to render them neat and
substantial, without any costly decorations;
but the first wing of the hospital
was scarcely inhabited, when several
eminent masters in painting, carving,
and other of the polite arts, were pleased
to contribute many elegant ornaments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>which are placed in the hospital as monuments
of the charity and abilities of
these great masters.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the court room are placed four
capital pictures, taken from sacred history,
the subjects of which are suitable
to the place for which they were designed.</p>

<p class='c030'>The first, which is painted by Mr.
Hayman, is taken from Exodus ii. 8, 9.
“The maid went and called the child’s
mother, and Pharaoh’s daughter said
unto her, Take this child away and
nurse it for me, and I will give you
wages.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The following verse is the subject of
the next picture, done by Mr. Hogarth,
viz. “And the child grew up, and
she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter,
and he became her son, and she
called his name Moses.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The third picture is the history of
Ishmael, painted by Mr. Highmore, the
subject of which is taken from Gen.
xxi. 17. “And the angel of the Lord
called to Hagar out of heaven, and
said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar?
Fear not, for God hath heard the
voice of the lad where he is.”</p>

<p class='c030'>The fourth picture is painted by Mr.
Wills, and is taken from Luke xviii. 16.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“Jesus said, Suffer little children to
come unto me, and forbid them
not, for of such is the kingdom of
heaven.”</p>

<p class='c030'>On each side of these pictures are
placed small drawings in circular frames
of the most considerable hospitals in and
about London, done by Mr. Haytley,
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Whale, and Mr.
Gainsborough.</p>

<p class='c030'>Over the chimney is placed a very
curious bas relief, done by Mr. Rysbrack,
and presented by him, representing
children employed in husbandry and navigation;
to which employments those
in the hospital are destined.</p>

<p class='c030'>The other ornaments of the room
were given by several ingenious workmen,
who had been employed in building
the hospital, and were willing to
contribute to adorn it. The stucco work
was given by Mr. William Wilton; the
marble chimney piece, by Mr. Deval;
the table with its frame curiously carved,
by Mr. John Saunderson; and the glass
by Mr. Hallet.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the other rooms of the hospital
are the pictures of several of the governors
and benefactors, viz. Mr.
Thomas Coram, by Mr. Hogarth; Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Milner and Mr. Jacobson, by Mr. Hudson;
Dr. Mead, by Mr. Ramsey; and
Mr. Emerson, by Mr. Highmore. In
the dining room is a large and beautiful
sea piece of the English fleet in the Downs
by Mr. Monamy; and over the chimney
in another room is Mr. Hogarth’s original
painting of the march to Finchley.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the chapel the altar piece is finely
painted by a fine Italian painter, representing
the wisemen making their offerings
to the infant Jesus, who is held in his mother’s
arms. And here we ought not to
forget the fine organ presented by Mr.
Handel, who has even made this of
great benefit to the hospital, and from
the most benevolent views, has enriched
the foundation by a new revenue raised
from the powers of harmony, and has
had a sacred oratorio performed several
times in the year, to crowded audiences,
in which he himself played upon
the organ gratis.</p>

<p class='c030'>Several very handsome shields done
in lead, were given by Mr. Ives, and
placed over the charity boxes, with proper
inscriptions; and other artists have
contributed their labours to the ornamenting
of the hospital and chapel;
for which they received the thanks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the corporation: and an inscription is
put up, to inform the public, that these
ornaments were the benefactions of the
several artists whose names are wrote
thereon; it being a fixed resolution of
the Governors, that no part of the
money given to this hospital be expended
in any thing that is not proper
to answer the good intentions of the
benefactors.</p>

<p class='c030'>After mentioning the above benefactions,
it ought not to be omitted, that
the Earl Marshal of England has been
pleased to honour the corporation with
the grant of a coat of arms; the kings
at arms, and officers of the Heralds
office, being so charitable as to remit
all the fees due to them on that occasion:
and that Dr. Cadogan, a Physician
of Bristol, has been at the pains of
writing an excellent pamphlet for the
use of the hospital, containing instructions
for the nursing and management of
children from their birth to three years
of age, which is published for the benefit
of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c030'>In the infancy of this hospital, those
children not exceeding two months old,
who were brought first were received,
till the number the Governors had agreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>to admit was completed; but this only
continued for a short time, the number
that came for admittance occasioned
great disturbance among the persons
who brought them, every one striving
to deliver her child first, for fear of being
excluded by delivering it too late.
This necessarily occasioned a new regulation.</p>

<p class='c030'>The persons who brought children,
were conduced into a large room; and
those who brought boys were seated
on benches at one end, and those who
brought girls, at the other. When
the hour of admittance was expired,
a bell was rung and the doors shut.
Two of the Governors then counted
how many had boys, and how many
girls; after which they put into one
bag as many white balls as there were
boys, and into another bag as many
white balls as there were girls to be admitted;
and to every twenty white balls
they added four red ones, and so in
proportion for any greater or lesser number;
after which they added so many
black balls, as together with the white
and red ones made the number of the
balls in each bag equal to the number
of persons who brought boys or girls.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>The balls being mixed together, one
of the Governors held the bag, and calling
the persons one by one from their
seats, each held up her hand open in
view of the Governors, and then putting
it into the bag drew out a ball; and if
it was a black one, she was immediately
led with her child out of the hospital;
while the persons who drew white and
red balls, were ordered into separate
rooms to prevent their changing them.</p>

<p class='c030'>When all the balls were drawn, and
the persons who had drawn black balls
were discharged, those who had drawn
white ones were brought in again, and
seated as before. Then one who had a
white ball was taken into a room, and
left alone, while her child was undressed
and examined in the presence of the
matron, and if the Physician, Surgeon,
or Apothecary attending, had any reason
to believe that it had any infectious disease,
or if it appeared to be above the age
of two months, it was dressed again
in its own cloaths, returned to the
person who brought it, and taken immediately
out of the hospital; but if
there were no such objections, it was received,
and the person who brought it
dismissed.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Every child thus received, had a different
letter of the alphabet tied to its
wrist; and both the clerk and steward
marked a billet with the letter fixed to
the wrist of the child, and in this paper
wrote its sex and supposed age;
the day and year when inspected; the
marks, if any, on its body; the particulars
of its dress; and if any writing or
remarkable thing was brought with it,
it was mentioned in the billet, and then
sealed up, marked with the letter of the
child on the outside. A female servant
then took the child, with the cloathing
of the hospital, into the ward appointed
for the taking in of children, and there
delivered it to the country nurse, who
had the same letter of the alphabet with
that of the child.</p>

<p class='c030'>In this manner they proceeded with respect
to all who had drawn white balls,
and then if any had been rejected, they
took as many white balls as there were
children so dismissed, put them into a
bag, and added as many black balls to
them, as together with the white, made
up the number of persons who had drawn
red balls. These were drawn in the
same manner as the first; but the persons
who now drew the black, might, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>they desired it, stay in the house till they
saw whether all the children of those
who in the second drawing had got
white balls, were received or rejected,
till the whole number of the children
appointed to be taken in were received.</p>

<p class='c030'>This method of drawing balls, was
doubtless as unexceptionable as any other
that could possibly have been invented,
since it left not the least room for partiality
in the choice: yet all who wished
well to this excellent charity, could not
avoid being concerned for those who
were disappointed in the hopes of gaining
admission for a child, whom they
had perhaps brought many miles out of
the country for that purpose, and at an
expence, which they were perhaps but
little able to support. This is, however,
now remedied, and the parliament has
granted very considerable sums, on condition
of all the children being taken in
that are brought of the proper age, and
free from infectious diseases.</p>

<p class='c030'>The children who are sent into the
country, are under the inspection of some
person of character in the neighbourhood,
and are cloathed and fed according
to the directions given in Dr. Cadogan’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span><i>Essay upon nursing</i>, during the three
years they remain there.</p>

<p class='c030'>Such children as have not had the
small pox, are inoculated at three years
of age, in a proper place out of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c030'>From three years old to six, they are
taught to read, and to learn the catechism;
and at proper intervals employed
in such a manner as may contribute to
their health, and induce a habit of activity,
hardiness and labour; and from that
time, their work is to be such bodily labour
as is most suitable to their age and
strength, and is most likely to fit them
for agriculture, or the sea service; such
as digging, hoeing, ploughing, hedging,
cleaving wood, and carrying burdens;
many of them are employed in the gardens
belonging to the hospital, where by
their labour they supply the house with
vegetables, and being instructed in gardening,
are kept in readiness for such
persons as may be inclined to take them
into their service.</p>

<p class='c030'>From six years of age, the girls are
employed in common needle-work, knitting
and spinning, and in the kitchen,
laundry, and household work, in order
to make them useful servants for such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>proper persons as may apply for them,
except so many as may be necessary to
be employed in the hospital; it being
intended to have no other female servants
in the house, but persons brought up in
it when they are of proper age.</p>

<p class='c030'>The diet of the children is plain and
good of the sort; their ordinary drink is
water; tea, coffee, tobacco, butter, and
strong drink, are never permitted to be
used by any children in the hospital.
Their diversions are ordered to be such
as are innocent, and require activity; and
all games of chance, swearing, indecent
language or behaviour, are strictly prohibited.
They are constantly to attend
divine service in the chapel on Sundays;
and the officers of the hospital are often
to remind them of the lowness of their
condition, that they may early imbibe
the principles of humility and gratitude
to their benefactors; and learn contentedly
to undergo the most servile and laborious
offices; for it is considered, that
notwithstanding the innocence of the
children, yet, as they are exposed and
abandoned by their parents, they ought
to submit to the lowest stations, and
should not be educated in such a manner,
as to put them upon a level with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>children of parents who have the humanity
and virtue to preserve, and the industry
to support them.</p>

<p class='c030'>When any person shall claim a child,
they are to leave a petition with the Secretary,
directed to the Governors: this,
the Secretary is to deliver to the general
committee, who are to transmit it to the
house committee, and to give orders,
that the person petitioning attend them
at a day appointed; when the house committee
shall enquire, what right they
have to the child; what are their circumstances;
whether they are able and
willing to provide for the child; what
security they can give for that purpose,
and what satisfaction they can make to
the hospital for the expence to which it
has been put, by the maintenance of the
child; which committee shall report the
same to the next general committee,
with their opinion thereupon. If the
proposal made by the parent, and the
report, is satisfactory to the general
committee, they are then, and not before,
to order the billets to be opened,
and the register searched; and if they
find the child is living, may make an
order to deliver such child to its parent
or relation, which order is not to be delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>till they have complied with the
terms required by the committee. Every
person to whom a child is so delivered, is
to provide cloathing for that child, in
which it is to be dressed, and the cloathing
of the hospital to be left with the
steward.</p>

<p class='c030'>When any are discharged on having
attained the age appointed for that purpose,
by act of parliament, that is,
twenty-four for the males, or twenty-one
for the females; or when any of the
girls shall be married, with the consent
of the committee; the general committee
may, at their discretion, give them
cloaths, money, or necessaries, not exceeding
the value of 10<i>l.</i> but as it is
hoped, that the males and females will
be able at those years to get an honest
livelihood by their industry, this charity
is to be cautiously and seldom practised,
except on the marriage of the girls.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>many turnings, by Brook street, Furnival’s
Inn, Leather lane, Hatton Garden,
Ely House, Field lane and Chick lane,
to the common sewer, where it returns
westward to Cow Cross, and so to Smithfield
Bars.</p>

<p class='c030'>From Smithfield Bars it runs with several
windings between Long lane and
Charter house lane to Goswell street, and
up that street northward to the bars.</p>

<p class='c030'>From Goswell street Bars, where the
manor of Finsbury begins, it winds across
Golden lane at the posts and chain
set up there, to the posts and chain in
Whitecross street, and from thence to
the posts and chain in Grub street; and
then thro’ Ropemakers alley to the posts
and chain in the highway from Moorgate;
and from thence by the north side
of the four quarters of Moorfields, all
abutting upon Finsbury manor, where
it returns northward up to the bars in
Bishopsgate street; and from thence eastward
into Spitalfields, abutting upon
Norton Falgate.</p>

<p class='c030'>From Norton Falgate it returns southward
by Spitalfields, and then southeast
by Wentworth street to Whitechapel
Bars.</p>

<p class='c030'>From Whitechapel Bars it winds more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>southerly, leaving out the Little Minories
and Goodman’s fields, from which
it returns westward to the posts and
chain in the Minories, and thence more
westerly till it comes to London Wall,
where it abuts upon the Tower liberty,
and there ends.</p>

<p class='c030'>Though this line in its several turnings
is of great length, yet the ground between
it and the wall is but narrow, so
that the extent in acres is not answerable
to its circumambulation. It is in
length 21,370 feet, which is about four
miles, and yet the ground comprehended
between the line of the city wall,
and this line of separation, is but 300
acres. <i>Stow.</i></p>

<p class='c030'>This house belongs to the French
church in Threadneedle street, near the
Royal Exchange, and to that in Black
Eagle street. The society by which it
is supported, Mr. <i>Maitland</i> observes, appears
to be the most charitable and generous,
from an inscription round a large
pewter dish in the possession of Mr.
Henry Guinand, an eminent French
merchant in Little St. Helen’s, (when
deacon of the church) who collected
the under-mentioned sum in gold, bank
notes, &amp;c. The inscription is as follows:
<i>La collecte qui s’est faite a l’eglise Françoise
de Londres, &amp; à celle de l’hopital
dans Black Eagle street, pour les pouvre
de la dite eglise, le 10 Mars, 1727–28.
a produit £1248 7 6.</i>  That is: The
collection made in the French church of
London, and that of the hospital in
Black Eagle street, for the poor of the
said churches, amounted to 1248<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>French Hospital</span>, contiguous to the
Pesthouse on the south side of St. Luke’s
parish, was erected in the year 1717,
and the Governors by letters patent of
the 4th of King George I. in 1718, were
constituted a body politic and corporate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>by the name of <i>The Governor and Directors
of the hospital for the poor French
Protestants, and their defendants, residing
in Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p class='c030'>This hospital at present contains 220
poor helpless men and women, 146 of
whom are upon the foundation, and are
plentifully supplied with all the necessaries
of life, at the expence of the hospital;
but the other seventy-four are paid
for by their friends, at the rate of 9<i>l.</i> a
year each. This charity also extends to
lunatics, for whose accommodation a
large infirmary is provided.</p>

<p class='c030'>To this foundation belong a Chaplain,
Physician, Surgeon, and other proper officers,
who carefully attend the pensioners,
and administer to their several
necessities. <i>Stow, last edit.</i></p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>French House of Charity</span>, in Spitalfields,
commonly called the <i>Soup</i>, was
erected about sixty years ago, for the
relief of necessitous families, whose number
in the year 1733 amounted to two
hundred and ninety-six. This house,
which is supported by the charitable benefactions
and contributions of well-disposed
persons, is under the direction of
a certain number of Governors and Governesses,
who at first supplied the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>under their care with money; but many
of them, without the least regard to
their distressed families, wickedly disposing
of the money in spirituous liquors,
tobacco, &amp;c. the managers agreed
for the future to allow these poor families
provisions instead of money, according
to their several necessities; some
therefore are allowed two portions a
week, others three or four, and the most
necessitous, six: each portion consisting
of a pan of good soup, mixed with six
ounces of bread, half a pound of meat,
and the same weight of dry bread. The
expence of this charity amounts to 500<i>l.</i>
<i>per annum</i>. <i>Maitland.</i></p>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>French Episcopal Church</span>, in Threadneedle
street, near the Royal Exchange.
In this place was formerly a synagogue
built by the Jews about the year 1231,
but in the reign of King Henry III. the
Christians obtained it of that Prince, who
granted it to the brotherhood of St. Anthony
of Vienna, and it was dedicated
to the Blessed Virgin. Afterwards an
hospital was added, called St. Anthony’s
of London, with a large free-school;
and this hospital which was allowed by
Edward IV. to have priests, clerks,
scholars, poor men and brethren, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>choristers, proctors, messengers, servitors,
&amp;c. like the convent of St. Anthony
of Vienna, was about the year
1485, appropriated to the collegiate
church of St. George at Windsor. This
school in the reign of Henry VI. was
one of the most celebrated in England,
and the scholars used at a certain time in
the year to go in procession; particularly
on the 15th of September 1562, there
set out from Mile end two hundred
children of St. Anthony’s school, who
marched through Aldgate down Cornhill,
to the Augustine Friars, with flags
and streamers flying, and drums beating.
But at length Johnson, one of the
schoolmasters, becoming a Prebendary
of Windsor, ruined the hospital; spoilt
the choir of the church; conveyed away
the plate and ornaments; then the bells;
and lastly turned the almsmen out of
their houses, allowing only 12<i>d</i>. a week
to each. These houses were afterwards
let out for the sake of the rent, and the
church at length became a place of worship
for the use of the French, who hold
it of the church of Windsor.</p>

<p class='c030'>This church being destroyed by the
fire of London, was rebuilt, and is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>possessed by the French and Walloons,
who here perform divine service, after
the manner of the church of England,
in the French tongue; but though it is a
pretty large and commodious edifice, it is
not sufficient to accommodate all the communicants;
they therefore make an exchange
with the Dutch church in Austin
Friars every first Sunday in the month,
where the Lord’s supper is constantly
administered in French, the Dutch
preaching on that day in the French
church in Threadneedle street.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>French Episcopal Church</span>, on the
east side of St. Martin’s lane. Here
originally stood the parish church of St.
Martin’s Ongar; that edifice was almost
destroyed by the fire of London,
but part of the steeple of the old church
remains; this has a dial which hangs over
into the street, and the parish is united
to St. Clement’s East Cheap. However,
as part of the tower and nave remained,
and was found capable of repairs, after
the above dreadful conflagration, a body
of the French protestants of the church
of England, obtained a lease of them
of the Minister and Churchwardens,
which was confirmed by an act of parliament;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and a church was erected for
their use, in which divine service is still
performed after the manner of the
church of England. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
